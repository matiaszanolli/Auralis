# Roadmap Updates - October 23, 2025

Three new features have been added to the Auralis development roadmap based on user request. All additions are in **Phase 4: Advanced Playback Features**.

---

## 1. Track Metadata Editing & Management (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Location**: Phase 4.1
**Timeline**: 4-5 days
**Priority**: üî¥ HIGH

### Summary
Allow users to edit and manage track metadata directly within Auralis, eliminating the need for external tools.

### Key Features
- **Individual & Batch Editing**: Edit single tracks or multiple tracks at once
- **Complete Metadata Support**: Title, Artist, Album, Track#, Year, Genre, BPM, Lyrics, Comments, and format-specific tags
- **Format Support**: MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG, WAV (using mutagen library)
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Auto-populate from filename patterns
  - Fetch metadata from MusicBrainz/Discogs
  - Tag cleanup tools (trim whitespace, fix capitalization)
  - Preview changes before saving
  - Backup before editing (optional)

### API Endpoints
- `PUT /api/library/tracks/:id/metadata` - Update track metadata
- `GET /api/library/tracks/:id/metadata/formats` - Get available format-specific tags
- `POST /api/library/tracks/batch/metadata` - Batch metadata update

### UI Components
- **EditMetadataDialog**: Form with all metadata fields, validation, preview
- **Batch Editor**: Edit multiple tracks with common fields
- **Context Menu**: Right-click ‚Üí "Edit Metadata" (Ctrl+E)
- **Track Detail View**: Inline editing for quick changes

### Impact
Essential for music library management. Users can maintain clean, organized metadata without leaving Auralis or using external tag editors like Kid3, EasyTAG, or MusicBrainz Picard.

## 2. Smart Chunk Shaping (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Location**: Phase 4.2
**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

### Summary
Improve chunked streaming by using intelligent chunk boundaries based on audio content (mood, energy, silence) rather than fixed 30-second intervals.

### Technical Approach
Replace fixed-time chunks with content-aware boundaries:

1. **Analyze audio waveform** for natural break points
2. **Detect silent sections** (below -60dB threshold)
3. **Identify mood/energy transitions** using RMS and spectral changes
4. **Detect tempo changes** and beat boundaries
5. **Optimize chunk sizes** (15-45s range)

### New Module: AdaptiveChunkShaper
```python
# Proposed API
analyze_chunk_points(audio, sr, min_chunk=15s, max_chunk=45s)
detect_mood_changes(audio, sr)
find_silent_regions(audio, sr, threshold=-60dB)
align_to_beats(audio, sr, boundaries)  # optional
```

### Integration
- Integrates with existing **ChunkedAudioProcessor** (already implemented in Phase 1.5)
- Cache chunk boundaries per track in database (avoid re-analysis)
- Fallback to fixed 30s chunks if analysis fails or for short tracks (<90s)
- Configurable via settings (enable/disable smart chunking)

### Benefits
- **More natural listening**: No splits in the middle of vocals or prominent sounds
- **Fewer audible artifacts**: Crossfades occur at natural transitions
- **Better UX**: Chunks align with musical structure
- **Minimal overhead**: Analysis completes in <1s per track

### Performance Criteria
- Chunk sizes: 15-45 seconds (streaming efficient, memory safe)
- Analysis time: <1 second per track
- Performance impact: <10% overhead
- Crossfades: Still seamless at new boundaries

## 3. Mastering Algorithm Performance Review (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Location**: Phase 5.1
**Timeline**: 7-10 days (4 phases)
**Priority**: üìä LOW-MEDIUM

### Summary
Conduct comprehensive review of the adaptive mastering algorithm to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

**Note**: Current performance is already excellent (52.8x real-time, 197x with optimizations). This review is about finding additional gains and ensuring we haven't missed easy optimizations.

### Four-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Profiling & Analysis (3-4 days)
- Profile entire processing pipeline (HybridProcessor, DSP stages, content analysis)
- Memory profiling (identify leaks, track NumPy allocations)
- Identify hotspots (CPU-intensive operations)
- Benchmark current performance (by file size, format, preset)
- **Tools**: cProfile, line_profiler, py-spy, memory_profiler

#### Phase 2: Algorithm Review (2-3 days)
- Review adaptive mastering algorithm logic:
  - ContentAnalyzer efficiency
  - AdaptiveTargetGenerator complexity
  - Genre classification overhead (ML model)
  - Psychoacoustic EQ (26 critical bands)
  - Dynamics processing (envelope followers, compression, limiting)
- Review DSP implementations (FFT, filters, resampling, stereo)
- Compare with reference implementations (librosa, scipy.signal, pydub)

#### Phase 3: Optimization Implementation (2-3 days)
**Investigate these potential optimizations**:

- **NumPy/SciPy**: In-place operations, vectorization, optimized functions
- **FFT**: Use FFTW via pyfftw (faster), cache FFT plans, optimal sizes, parallelize stereo
- **Caching**: Cache content analysis, genre classification, FFT intermediates
- **Parallel Processing**: Parallelize stereo channels, batch operations, chunk processing
- **Algorithm Simplifications**:
  - Reduce psychoacoustic EQ from 26 to 18 bands (still perceptually accurate)
  - Simplify genre classification for real-time
  - Optimize envelope follower (reduce oversampling)
  - Skip analysis steps for low-intensity processing
- **Memory**: More aggressive memory pooling, float32 vs float64, release intermediate arrays

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1-2 days)
- Benchmark each optimization (measure speedup)
- Audio quality verification (PESQ, VISQOL scores)
- A/B test original vs optimized output (should be identical or imperceptibly different)
- Verify no test suite regressions
- **Documentation**: Create MASTERING_ALGORITHM_PERFORMANCE.md report

### Success Criteria
- Comprehensive profiling report completed
- At least 3 significant bottlenecks identified
- At least 2 optimizations implemented and tested
- **Performance improvement**: 10-20% on common use cases
- Audio quality maintained (verified by objective metrics)
- No regressions in existing test suite
- Documentation updated with findings

### Impact
- Faster processing (10-20% speedup target)
- Lower CPU usage
- Better battery life on laptops
- Identify future optimization opportunities

### Risk
Medium - Requires careful testing to ensure audio quality is maintained. Any algorithm changes must be validated to ensure they don't degrade output quality.
