      "20.1 dB crest exceeds Rush 1977 analog (19.4 dB)",
      "Very quiet -24.4 LUFS compared to modern -8 to -12 LUFS",
      "Early CD mastering was conservative (left headroom)",
      "Tight variation: 4.0 dB LUFS range, 3.6 dB crest range",
      "Excellent dynamics but lacks presence and warmth of analog",
