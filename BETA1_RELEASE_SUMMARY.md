## üêõ How to Report Issues

**GitHub Issues**: https://github.com/matiaszanolli/Auralis/issues

**When reporting audio quality issues**:
1. **Describe the issue**: What did you hear?
2. **When does it occur**: Specific timestamps, tracks, presets?
3. **Audio file details**: Format, bitrate, sample rate
4. **Steps to reproduce**: How to trigger the issue reliably
5. **Logs**: Check `~/.auralis/logs/` for errors

**Example Report**:
```
Title: Audio fuzziness at 30-second intervals

Description: I hear distortion/fuzziness every ~30 seconds during
enhanced playback with Adaptive preset.

When: Occurs consistently at chunk boundaries (30s, 60s, 90s, etc.)

Audio Details:
- Format: FLAC 16-bit/44.1kHz
- Track: "Song Title" by Artist
- Duration: 5:23
- Preset: Adaptive, Intensity: 100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable enhancement
2. Select Adaptive preset
3. Play track
4. Listen at 30s, 60s, 90s marks

Logs: Attached main.log showing chunk processing
```

## üìà Testing Focus for Beta.1

**Critical Areas** (please test extensively):
1. **Chunk transitions**: Listen for fuzziness, volume jumps at 30s intervals
2. **Different presets**: Test Adaptive, Gentle, Warm, Bright, Punchy
3. **Various audio formats**: FLAC, MP3, WAV, OGG
4. **Long tracks**: 5+ minute songs to catch multiple chunk transitions
5. **Volume consistency**: Pay attention to loudness changes during playback

**How to Test**:
1. Play a 5+ minute track with enhancement ON
2. Use Adaptive preset at 100% intensity
3. Listen carefully at 30s, 60s, 90s, 120s, etc.
4. Note any fuzziness, distortion, or volume jumps
5. Report findings using template above
