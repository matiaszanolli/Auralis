## Known Issues

### Beta Limitations

#### High Priority (Will Fix Before 1.0)
1. **Gapless Playback**: Small gap between tracks (~100ms)
   - Workaround: Use crossfade in settings
2. **Large Library Load**: First load of 50k+ tracks takes ~5 seconds
   - Subsequent loads are instant (cached)
3. **Artist Listing**: Slow for libraries with 1000+ artists (468ms)
   - Workaround: Use search instead

#### Medium Priority (Post-1.0)
1. **Lyrics Display**: Not yet implemented
2. **Visualizer Performance**: Can lag on older hardware with enhancement enabled
   - Workaround: Disable visualizer in settings
3. **Metadata Editing**: Basic fields only (advanced editing coming soon)

#### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Cloud Sync**: Not available
2. **Mobile App**: Not planned for 1.0
3. **Plugin System**: Future consideration

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Linux**:
- Wayland: Window may not show on first launch (restart app)
- AppImage: May need to allow execution permissions

**macOS**:

## Beta Testing Tips

### What to Focus On

1. **Test Different Music**: Try various genres, quality levels
2. **Large Libraries**: Add 1000+ tracks if possible
3. **Rapid Interactions**: Click fast, switch presets quickly
4. **Long Sessions**: Leave it running for hours
5. **Edge Cases**: Corrupt files, weird metadata, huge files

### How to Help Most

1. **Report Bugs**: Even if already reported, +1 helps prioritize
2. **Suggest Improvements**: UI, features, workflows
3. **Share on Social Media**: Help us reach more beta testers
4. **Be Specific**: "Slow" is less useful than "Takes 5s to load 1000 tracks"
