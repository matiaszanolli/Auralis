"""
Security Tests Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Security vulnerability and exploit prevention tests.

Test Categories:
- test_input_validation.py: Input sanitization and injection prevention
- test_authentication.py: Authentication and authorization security
- test_data_security.py: Data protection and encryption
- test_api_security.py: API endpoint security and rate limiting

These tests validate security controls and exploit prevention.

NOTE: Many input validation tests (SQL injection, XSS, path traversal,
command injection) are already covered in boundary tests. These tests
focus on additional security concerns and deeper validation.
