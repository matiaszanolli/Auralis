## 🎉 Major Accomplishments

### 1. Album Artwork Fix (P1) - COMPLETED

**Problem**: Album artwork not displaying anywhere in the application

**Root Cause**: Artwork extraction code existed but was never integrated into library scanning

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `TrackRepository` to automatically extract artwork when tracks are added
- Updated `LibraryManager` to pass `album_repository` to `track_repository`
- Artwork now automatically extracted from embedded metadata (MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG)

**Files Modified**:
- `auralis/library/repositories/track_repository.py` (+20 lines)
- `auralis/library/manager.py` (reordered initialization)

**Testing Results**: ✅ FULLY VERIFIED
- Extracted 159-byte test artwork from MP3 file
- Saved to `~/.auralis/artwork/album_2105_3c4a6f38.jpg`
- API returns HTTP 200 with valid JPEG
- Database correctly stores artwork paths

**Git Commits**:
- `e9cc9ee` - Code fix
- `b4c8377` - Documentation
- `cc833af` - Test results

### 2. Preset Switching Limitation - DOCUMENTED

**User Report**: "Every time I change presets I get forced to wait"

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Current streaming architecture serves complete processed files
- Preset change = new stream URL = complete reload
- Multi-tier buffer exists but can't be utilized
- HTML5 audio element discards buffer on URL change

**Documentation Created**:
- [PRESET_SWITCHING_LIMITATION.md](PRESET_SWITCHING_LIMITATION.md) (289 lines)
  - Complete technical analysis
  - Code flow diagrams
  - Workarounds for users
  - Proper solution design (MSE)

**Priority Assignment**: P2 (Medium)
- Not a bug - architectural limitation
- Workaround available (choose preset before playing)
- Proper fix requires MSE implementation (~1 week)

**Git Commits**:
- `40c673f` - Technical documentation
- `23efb8f` - Updated known issues

---

### 3. Beta.3 Roadmap - CREATED

**MSE-Based Progressive Streaming** added as **P0 MAXIMUM PRIORITY**

**Roadmap Details**:
- [BETA3_ROADMAP.md](BETA3_ROADMAP.md) (433 lines)
- Complete 4-phase implementation plan
- Code examples for backend and frontend
- Expected results: 20-50x faster preset switching
- Timeline: 8-12 days focused development

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Backend chunk streaming API (2-3 days)
2. Frontend MSE integration (3-4 days)
3. Multi-tier buffer integration (1 day)
4. Testing & optimization (2-3 days)

**Git Commit**: `421c97c`

### 4. Comprehensive Testing - COMPLETED

**Automated Tests**: ✅ ALL PASSED

**Test 1**: Backend Health
- ✅ Backend running on port 8765
- ✅ API responding to health checks
- ✅ Database accessible (39,743 tracks, 2,105 albums)

**Test 2**: Artist Pagination (P1 Fix)
- ✅ Response time: ~394ms (was 468ms in Beta.1)
- ✅ **15.8% improvement**
- ✅ Pagination working correctly

**Test 3**: Album Artwork (P1 Fix)
- ✅ Automatic extraction working
- ✅ API endpoints functional
- ✅ Filesystem verification passed
- ✅ Database integration correct

**Documentation**:
- [BETA2_TEST_SUMMARY.md](BETA2_TEST_SUMMARY.md) - Complete automated test results
- [BETA2_MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md](BETA2_MANUAL_TEST_PLAN.md) - Manual testing procedures
- [ARTWORK_TEST_RESULTS.md](ARTWORK_TEST_RESULTS.md) - Artwork testing details

**Git Commit**: `750db34`
