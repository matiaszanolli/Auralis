## Phase 2: Data Collection and Analysis (IN PROGRESS 🔄)

### Task 2.1: Analyze Queensrÿche Operation: Mindcrime Results
**Status**: Awaiting track-by-track analysis
**Assigned to**: Next session
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Steps**:
1. Locate Matchering output directory for Operation: Mindcrime
2. Extract processing stats for each track:
   - Track name, duration
   - Original RMS, boost applied, final RMS
   - Processing time, iteration count
3. Create summary table (similar to The Cure analysis)
4. Identify prog metal-specific patterns
5. Compare against The Cure (alt-rock) patterns

**Expected Insights**:
- Is boost requirement similar (+4 to +9 dB)?
- Does RMS target remain -12.05 dB?
- Are there genre-specific frequency balance differences?
- Why does user say "improves so much...hard to believe"?

**Deliverable**: Add Operation: Mindcrime section to `MATCHERING_REFERENCE_ANALYSIS.md`

---

### Task 2.2: Gather Additional Album Data (Optional)
**Status**: Pending user decision
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: Variable (depends on albums selected)

**Candidate Albums** (suggested in conversation):
1. Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon (1973) - Classic prog rock
2. Radiohead - OK Computer (1997) - Alternative rock
3. Red Hot Chili Peppers - Californication (1999) - De-mastering test (over-compressed original)
4. Daft Punk - Random Access Memories (2013) - Electronic with dynamics
5. Opeth - Ghost Reveries (2005) - Progressive metal (Jens Bogren)

**Process** (if user provides):
1. Run Matchering with appropriate reference (Steven Wilson for prog/metal, Quincy Jones for pop)
2. Document processing stats
3. Add to reference analysis
4. Build comprehensive genre coverage

```python
# Compare metrics across albums
albums = [
    "The Cure - Wish",
    "Queensrÿche - Operation: Mindcrime",
    # More albums as available
]

for album in albums:
    results = load_validation_results(album)

    # Aggregate pass rates
    lufs_pass_rate = results['tests_passed']['lufs']
    dr_pass_rate = results['tests_passed']['dynamic_range']
    freq_pass_rate = results['tests_passed']['frequency_balance']
    stereo_pass_rate = results['tests_passed']['stereo_width']
    spectral_pass_rate = results['tests_passed']['spectral_similarity']

    overall_pass_rate = mean([...])

# Identify weakest areas
if min(pass_rates) == lufs_pass_rate:
    print("Improvement needed: Loudness targeting")
elif min(pass_rates) == dr_pass_rate:
    print("Improvement needed: Dynamic range preservation")
# ... etc.
```

**Deliverable**: `VALIDATION_SUMMARY_REPORT.md` with recommendations

---

## Phase 4: Auralis Improvements (Based on Findings)

### Potential Improvement Areas

**Note**: These are speculative until validation tests are run. Actual improvements will be based on test results.

---

#### Improvement 4.1: Adaptive Loudness Targeting
**Trigger**: If LUFS tests consistently fail (>20% failure rate)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Problem**: Adaptive targets may not match professional standards accurately

**Current Implementation**:
```python
# auralis/core/analysis/content_analyzer.py
class ContentAnalyzer:
    def analyze_content(self, audio, sr):
        # Current: Calculate target based on spectral analysis
        target_lufs = self._estimate_target_loudness(features)
        # May not match genre standards
```

**Proposed Fix**:
```python
# Use reference library benchmarks
from auralis.learning.reference_library import get_quality_benchmark

class ContentAnalyzer:
    def analyze_content(self, audio, sr):
        # Detect genre
        genre = self._detect_genre(features)

        # Use professional benchmark
        benchmark = get_quality_benchmark(genre)
        target_lufs = benchmark['target_lufs']

        # Adjust for content characteristics
        if features['rms'] < threshold:
            target_lufs += adjustment

        return target_lufs
```

**Validation**: Re-run tests, verify LUFS pass rate improves to >90%

---

#### Improvement 4.2: Iterative RMS Correction
**Trigger**: If final RMS/LUFS has >0.5 dB error from target
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

**Problem**: Single-pass processing may not reach exact target

**Current Implementation**:
```python
# auralis/core/hybrid_processor.py
class HybridProcessor:
    def process(self, audio):
        # Single pass
        processed = self._apply_processing(audio, target)
        return processed
```

**Proposed Fix**:
```python
class HybridProcessor:
    def process(self, audio, max_iterations=3):
        processed = audio

        for i in range(max_iterations):
            # Apply processing
            processed = self._apply_processing(processed, target)

            # Measure result
            actual_lufs = measure_lufs(processed)
            error = target_lufs - actual_lufs

            # Check convergence
            if abs(error) < 0.5:  # Within 0.5 dB
                break

            # Adjust target for next iteration
            target_lufs += error * 0.8  # 80% correction

        return processed
```

**Validation**: Verify final LUFS within ±0.2 dB of target

---

#### Improvement 4.3: Frequency Response Refinement
**Trigger**: If frequency balance tests fail (>20% failure rate)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Problem**: EQ curve may not match professional frequency balance

**Current Implementation**:
```python
# auralis/dsp/realtime_adaptive_eq.py
class RealtimeAdaptiveEQ:
    def generate_eq_curve(self, spectrum, genre):
        # Current: Adaptive curve based on spectral analysis
        # May not match Steven Wilson / Quincy Jones standards
```

**Proposed Fix**:
1. **Analyze Reference Frequency Response**:
   ```python
   # Add to reference_analyzer.py
   ref_profile = analyzer.analyze_reference(
       ReferenceTrack(...),
       "Porcupine Tree - Prodigal.flac"
   )

   # ref_profile.third_octave_response contains target curve
   ```

2. **Use Reference Curve as Template**:
   ```python
   class RealtimeAdaptiveEQ:
       def generate_eq_curve(self, spectrum, genre):
           # Get reference curve for genre
           ref_curve = self._get_reference_curve(genre)

           # Measure current spectrum
           current_curve = self._measure_third_octave(spectrum)

           # Calculate correction EQ
           eq_curve = ref_curve - current_curve

           # Apply smoothing and limits
           eq_curve = self._smooth_and_limit(eq_curve)

           return eq_curve
   ```

**Validation**: Verify spectral similarity >85%

---

#### Improvement 4.4: Dynamic Range Preservation
**Trigger**: If DR tests show <85% preservation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

**Problem**: Compression may be too aggressive, reducing DR below professional standards

**Current Implementation**:
```python
# auralis/dsp/dynamics/compressor.py
class AdaptiveCompressor:
    def apply_compression(self, audio, ratio=3.0):
        # Fixed ratio may over-compress
```

**Proposed Fix**:
```python
class AdaptiveCompressor:
    def apply_compression(self, audio, target_dr):
        # Measure input DR
        input_dr = calculate_dynamic_range(audio)

        # Calculate required ratio to achieve target DR
        if input_dr > target_dr:
            ratio = self._calculate_ratio(input_dr, target_dr)
        else:
            ratio = 1.0  # No compression needed

        # Apply compression
        compressed = self._compress(audio, ratio)

        # Verify DR
        output_dr = calculate_dynamic_range(compressed)

        # Ensure target DR achieved
        if output_dr < target_dr * 0.85:
            # Reduce compression
            ratio *= 0.8
            compressed = self._compress(audio, ratio)

        return compressed
```

**Validation**: Verify DR ≥85% of reference

---

## Phase 5: Continuous Validation

### Task 5.1: Add Regression Tests
**Status**: After improvements implemented
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Goal**: Ensure improvements don't regress

**Implementation**:
```python
# tests/validation/test_regression.py
def test_the_cure_wish_quality_maintained():
    """Ensure The Cure - Wish maintains >80% pass rate"""
    results = process_and_validate("The Cure - Wish")
    assert results['pass_rate'] >= 0.80

def test_steven_wilson_standards_maintained():
    """Ensure progressive rock meets Steven Wilson DR standards"""
    results = validate_genre(Genre.PROGRESSIVE_ROCK)
    assert results['tests_passed']['dynamic_range'] == True
```

---

### Task 5.2: Create Quality Dashboard
**Status**: Future enhancement
**Priority**: LOW
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Goal**: Visualize validation results over time

**Features**:
- Pass rate trends
- Metric distributions (LUFS, DR, frequency balance)
- Genre-specific quality scores
- Comparison charts (Auralis vs Matchering vs Reference)

**Tech Stack**: Python + Streamlit or Dash
