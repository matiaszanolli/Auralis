# Phase 2.5.2B: Listening Test Instructions for Mastering Engineer

**Test Date**: November 24, 2025
**Test Type**: Blind A/B Comparison
**Purpose**: Validate fingerprint-based adaptive mastering parameters against manual presets
**Listener**: You (Years of remastering experience)

---

## Overview

This is a **blind A/B listening test** comparing two different mastering approaches:

- **Method A & B** (randomized): One uses fingerprint-based automatic parameters, the other uses manual presets
- **You won't know** which is which until after you submit your scores
- **4 different genres** to test across diverse mastering scenarios
- **Time commitment**: ~30-45 minutes (allowing for multiple listens per track)

---

## The Question

**Does the fingerprint-based mastering system produce comparable or superior results to manual presets?**

Success is defined as:
- Fingerprint average score **≥ 3.5/5** (prefer or equal to manual)
- If achieved, we proceed to Phase 3 (chunk processing and production deployment)

## What to Listen For

### 1. **Frequency Balance** (1-5)

The overall EQ treatment and spectral balance:

- **1 = Too much scooped/thin OR too much presence/harsh**
  - Unnatural frequency response, obvious problem areas
  - Missing fundamental information or overly emphasized bands

- **2 = Slightly unbalanced but acceptable**
  - Minor EQ issues, but not distracting
  - Could be clearer or more open in places

- **3 = Well-balanced** (neutral/equal)
  - Both sound equally balanced
  - No clear preference for either approach

- **4 = Good balance with slight preference**
  - More natural, slightly more open or cohesive
  - Better separation of frequency ranges

- **5 = Excellent, clear balance**
  - Professional, natural response
  - Frequencies sit perfectly, nothing fighting

**What to ask yourself**:
- Is the bass clear and punchy (not muddy or thin)?
- Are midrange vocals/instruments present without being nasal?
- Are highs/air clear and extended (not rolled off or harsh)?
- Does the overall spectrum sound balanced?

---

### 2. **Dynamics & Punch** (1-5)

How the compression and dynamic range treatment affects the mix:

- **1 = Over-compressed/lifeless OR too dynamic/jumping**
  - Pumping artifacts, obvious compression damage
  - OR inconsistent levels, lacks cohesion

- **2 = Slightly problematic dynamics**
  - Noticeable artifacts or slight loss of punchiness
  - Acceptable but has minor issues

- **3 = Well-handled dynamics** (neutral/equal)
  - Transients intact, no obvious compression issues
  - Both versions handle dynamics similarly

- **4 = Good dynamic handling with slight preference**
  - Smooth and punchy, transients preserved
  - Compression feels transparent

- **5 = Excellent dynamics**
  - Extremely natural, transparent compression
  - Transients snap, overall has great punch/energy

**What to ask yourself**:
- Are transients (drums, attacks) punchy and clear?
- Does the mix feel compressed or natural?
- Are there any obvious compression artifacts (pumping, breathing)?
- Does it maintain energy throughout the song?

---

### 3. **Loudness & Level Matching** (1-5)

Whether the mastering achieved the target loudness appropriately:

- **1 = Significantly too quiet OR too loud**
  - Clearly undermastered or overmastered
  - Obvious loudness mismatch

- **2 = Slightly off in loudness**
  - Noticeably quieter or louder than expected
  - Acceptable but noticeable

- **3 = Well-matched loudness** (neutral/equal)
  - Both at similar perceived loudness level
  - -16 LUFS target well-matched

- **4 = Good loudness with slight preference**
  - Appropriate loudness level for medium (streaming, radio, etc.)
  - Feels appropriately loud

- **5 = Perfect loudness**
  - Ideal loudness level, perfectly matched to -16 LUFS
  - Sits well with other professional masters

**What to ask yourself**:
- Is it loud enough (not too quiet for streaming)?
- Is it reasonable for the genre and source?
- Does it feel "mastered" or still raw?
- Is it consistent with professional mastering standards?

---

### 4. **Overall Quality & Preference** (1-5)

Your gut preference: which would you use, recommend, or prefer to listen to?

- **1 = Heavily prefer B (manual)**
  - B is clearly superior
  - A has significant issues compared to B

- **2 = Moderately prefer B**
  - B is better, but A is acceptable
  - B would be the choice if I had to pick

- **3 = No clear preference (equal)**
  - Both are equally good or bad
  - Genuinely can't pick one over the other

- **4 = Moderately prefer A (fingerprint)**
  - A is better, but B is acceptable
  - A would be the choice if I had to pick

- **5 = Heavily prefer A (fingerprint)**
  - A is clearly superior
  - B has significant issues compared to A

**What to ask yourself**:
- Which version would I pay a mastering engineer for?
- Which sounds more professional?
- Which would I use as a reference?
- Which version is more "finished"?

## Test Procedure

### Step 1: Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Use good speakers or headphones** (reference-quality, calibrated if possible)
2. **Quiet listening environment** (minimize distractions and noise)
3. **Set moderate listening level** (don't blast it, don't play it quietly)
4. **Have the scoring sheet ready** (see below)

### Step 2: Listen to Each Pair (25-35 minutes)

For **each genre** (4 total):

1. **Listen to A** - Full play-through (3 seconds)
2. **Listen to B** - Full play-through (3 seconds)
3. **Compare** - A/B back-to-back if needed (listen multiple times)
4. **Score** - Rate on all 4 criteria (frequency, dynamics, loudness, preference)
5. **Notes** - Write brief comments on what you noticed

**Pro Tips**:
- Multiple listens are encouraged
- A/B switch back and forth to hear differences
- Listen at least twice through before scoring
- Trust your ears—no right answer, just your perception
- Consider the genre context (bass-heavy ≠ vocal pop standard)

### Step 3: Submit Results (5 minutes)

Return this filled-out form with scores and feedback.

## Analysis & Methodology

### How Results Will Be Analyzed

1. **Average Score Calculation**
   - All 4 "Overall Quality" scores across all genres
   - Target: ≥ 3.5/5 for fingerprint approach success

2. **Preference Analysis**
   - Count A vs B preferences across all genres
   - Target: ≥ 60% prefer fingerprint (if A/B assignment supports it)

3. **Per-Genre Breakdown**
   - Identify if fingerprint works better on some genres
   - Inform tuning decisions if needed

4. **Feedback Analysis**
   - Qualitative comments for specific improvement areas
   - Document what works and what doesn't

### Success Criteria

**PASS** (Proceed to Phase 3):
- Fingerprint average ≥ 3.5/5 across all genres
- 60% + of overall preferences align with fingerprint

**CONDITIONAL** (Minor Tuning):
- Fingerprint 3.0-3.5 with specific improvement areas identified
- Implement targeted parameter adjustments
- Re-test if significant changes made

**FAIL** (Major Tuning Required):
- Fingerprint < 3.0/5 or < 40% preference
- Significant algorithm re-evaluation needed
- Document findings and tuning approach

## Background Context

### What Are We Testing?

The system extracts a **25-dimensional audio fingerprint** (spectral, dynamic, harmonic characteristics) and uses that to automatically generate mastering parameters:

- EQ (frequency balance adjustments)
- Compression (dynamic range control)
- Leveling (loudness matching to -16 LUFS)

These are compared against **hand-crafted presets** that a mastering engineer would typically apply.

### Why This Matters

If fingerprint-based parameters are competitive with manual presets, we can:
1. Offer fast, consistent mastering without human bottlenecks
2. Apply mastering intelligently based on actual audio content
3. Maintain quality while reducing manual work

### Current Status

- Framework: ✅ Complete, 5/5 tests passing
- Parameters: ✅ Deterministic, reasonable ranges
- Audio: ✅ Generated, 8 files ready
- **Next**: Your listening test feedback
