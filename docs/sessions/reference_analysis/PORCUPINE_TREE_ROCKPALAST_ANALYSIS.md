---

## 🎵 Executive Summary

Analyzing Porcupine Tree's 2006 Rockpalast live concert provides **critical insights into live recording mastering** that differ substantially from studio masters (Deep Purple).

**Key Discovery**: Live bootleg recordings have **FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT** baseline characteristics that require different mastering approaches than studio recordings.

**The Difference**:
- **Bootleg**: Extremely dark (374-571 Hz centroid), mono-ish stereo (0.17-0.23), massive bass boost (+13-17 dB vs mid)
- **Matchering**: Brightened to 973-1010 Hz, wide stereo (0.38-0.46), reduced bass (+10-12 dB vs mid)

This is **NOT** a case of "over-boosting bass" - this is a case of **correcting bootleg characteristics**!

## 📊 Detailed Analysis

### The Two Different Starting Points

#### Why Different?

**Studio Recording** (Deep Purple):
- Professionally mixed
- Balanced frequency response
- Stereo properly recorded
- Optimized for mastering

**Live Bootleg** (Porcupine Tree):
- Audience/live recording
- Poor frequency response (audio engineering)
- Narrow/mono stereo (recording angle, speaker placement)
- Raw, unprocessed audio

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: Bootleg Recordings Are EXTREMELY Dark

**Evidence**:
- Spectral centroid: 374-571 Hz (vs. normal 650-1000 Hz)
- Bass-to-mid: +13.6 to +16.8 dB (vs. normal +1-2 dB)
- Treble-to-mid: -17.8 dB (basically absent)

**Why This Happens**:
- Live recording captures room acoustics poorly
- Speaker placement/angle affects frequency response
- Bootleg recording equipment has poor treble
- Bass frequencies travel better in venues

**Implication**: **Bootleg ≠ Bad mastering. It's a recording characteristic.**

---

### Discovery 2: Bootleg Stereo Is Mono-ish

**Evidence**:
- Width: 0.17-0.23 (vs. professional 0.4-0.6)
- Correlation: 0.77-0.83 (vs. professional 0.5-0.7)

**Why This Happens**:
- Bootleg recording position captures narrow stereo image
- Can be from single microphone or pair placed suboptimally
- Live recording angle affects stereo capture

**Implication**: **Stereo expansion is valid mastering technique for bootlegs**

---

### Discovery 3: Matchering's Mastering Philosophy for Live Recordings

**Approach**:
1. **Aggressive brightening** (+439 to +599 Hz spectral shift)
2. **Bass reduction** (more aggressive than studio -2.3 to -5.5 dB)
3. **Stereo expansion** (100% wider)
4. **Loudness increase** (+1.1 to +3.2 dB) while maintaining peaks
5. **Dynamic range preservation** (consistent +23.5 dB expansion)

**Rationale**:
- Bootleg is too dark → brighten aggressively
- Bootleg is too bass-heavy → reduce bass significantly
- Bootleg is too narrow → expand stereo
- Can increase overall loudness because original peaks are already hot
- Expand DR because bootleg is compressed from recording process

---

### Discovery 4: Different DR Expansion Pattern

**Consistent Finding**: Both tracks show exactly **+23.5 dB DR expansion**

```
CD 1 Track 2:  96.3 dB → 119.9 dB (exactly +23.5)
CD 2 Track 1:  96.3 dB → 119.9 dB (exactly +23.5)
```

**Why Exactly the Same?**
- Likely indicates Matchering expanded headroom intelligently
- Could be "expand to available ceiling" approach
- Shows Matchering detected compression artifact in bootleg

**Implication**: **Bootleg was artificially compressed (or recording clipped)**

---

## 🎯 Implications for Auralis

### Key Insight: Studio vs Live Processing Are Different

**Deep Purple (Studio Live - Professional Mix)**:
- Bass: +1.15 dB (modest)
- Treble: +2.3 dB (modest)
- Stereo: minimal change (already good)

**Porcupine Tree (Live Bootleg - Raw Recording)**:
- Bass reduction: -3 to -5.5 dB (aggressive!)
- Treble boost: +2 to +4.6 dB (moderate)
- Stereo expansion: +0.21-0.23 (major)
- DR expansion: +23.5 dB (major)
- RMS increase: +1.1 to +3.2 dB (substantial)

### Recommendation 1: Detect Recording Type

**Bootleg characteristics to identify**:
- Spectral centroid < 500 Hz (very dark)
- Bass-to-mid ratio > +12 dB (excessive bass)
- Stereo width < 0.3 (narrow/mono)
- Usually presents all three together

**Different Processing for**:
- Professional studio recordings (like Deep Purple Steven Wilson)
- Live concert recordings (like Porcupine Tree)
- Bootleg recordings (like Porcupine Tree Rockpalast)

### Recommendation 2: Aggressive Treble Boost for Bootlegs

**Finding**: Bootlegs need **much more treble** than studio recordings

**Steven Wilson studio**: +2.3 dB treble boost
**Matchering bootleg**: +2.4 to +4.6 dB treble boost

**Auralis Action**: For detected bootlegs, increase treble boost aggressiveness

### Recommendation 3: Bass Reduction Not Bass Boost

**Finding**: Even though bass seems boosted, it's actually **reduction from excessive bootleg bass**

**Pattern**:
- Bootleg: +16 dB bass-to-mid (way too much)
- Professional: +10-12 dB bass-to-mid (reduced toward normal)
- Normal music: +1-2 dB bass-to-mid

**Auralis Action**: For bootlegs, apply BASS REDUCTION (not boost) to bring bass down to normal levels

### Recommendation 4: Stereo Expansion is Valid

**Finding**: Expanding narrow bootleg stereo image is standard technique

**Matchering approach**:
- Bootleg width 0.17-0.23 → Professional width 0.38-0.46 (100% expansion)
- Reduces L/R correlation to create width perception

**Auralis Action**: Implement optional stereo expansion for narrow recordings

## 🎵 How Matchering Did It

### The Matchering Approach

1. **Detected bootleg characteristics** (dark + narrow + hot peaks)
2. **Applied aggressive brightening** (spectral shift +439-599 Hz)
3. **Reduced bass dominance** (-3 to -5.5 dB adjustment)
4. **Expanded stereo** (+0.21-0.23 width increase)
5. **Increased overall loudness** (+1-3 dB RMS)
6. **Expanded dynamic range** (+23.5 dB - very significant)
7. **Maintained peak control** (-0.02 dB optimization)

### What This Tells Us About Matchering

- ✅ Uses spectrum analysis to detect issues
- ✅ Applies genre/type-specific processing
- ✅ Handles both studio and bootleg recordings
- ✅ Balances loudness vs peak control
- ✅ Expands DR despite increasing loudness
- ✅ Adjusts stereo processing per recording type

## 📝 Specific Numbers for Auralis

### For Bootleg Recording Detection

```
If: Spectral Centroid < 500 Hz
AND: Bass-to-Mid Ratio > 12 dB
AND: Stereo Width < 0.3

Then: APPLY BOOTLEG PROCESSING
├─ Bass reduction: -4.0 dB (aggressive!)
├─ Treble boost: +4.0 dB (more than normal)
├─ Stereo expand: +0.2 (widen narrow image)
├─ RMS boost: +1.5 to +3.0 dB
└─ Maintain: Peak control at -0.02 dB
```

### For Studio Recording (Normal Case)

```
If: Spectral Centroid > 600 Hz
AND: Bass-to-Mid Ratio 1-3 dB
AND: Stereo Width > 0.35

Then: APPLY STUDIO PROCESSING
├─ Bass boost: +1.0-1.5 dB (as per Deep Purple analysis)
├─ Midrange: -1.0 dB (reduction)
├─ Treble boost: +2.0 dB (moderate)
├─ Stereo: minimal change
└─ RMS: modest increase
```

## 🔄 How This Relates to Phase 1

### Phase 1 Update: Need Two Different Presets

**Current Phase 1**: Based on Deep Purple studio analysis
- Bass: +1.5 dB
- Mid: -1.0 dB
- Treble: +2.0 dB

**NEW for Bootleg Processing**:
- Bass: -4.0 dB (reduction, not boost!)
- Treble: +4.0 dB (double the studio amount)
- Stereo: +0.2 expansion
- RMS: +2.0 to +3.0 dB

### This Is Good News

We don't have "too much bass boost" on bootlegs - we have the **wrong processing model**. Bootlegs need:
- **Bass REDUCTION** (not boost)
- **More aggressive treble**
- **Stereo expansion**
- **Higher overall loudness**

This is **completely different** from studio recording mastering.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For This Session

1. **Create bootleg detection algorithm**
   - Analyze spectral centroid
   - Analyze bass-to-mid ratio
   - Analyze stereo width
   - Flag as "bootleg" if all three match

2. **Create bootleg processing preset**
   - Different EQ curve (more aggressive treble)
