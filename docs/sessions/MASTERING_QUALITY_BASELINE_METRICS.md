# Mastering Quality - Baseline Metrics
**Date**: November 17, 2025
**Status**: ⚠️ SUPERSEDED (2026-07-08) — see note below
**Purpose**: Quantify current quality across all metrics as starting point for improvements

> **Superseded notice (2026-07-08)**: These baselines were measured against the real-time adaptive pipeline (`HybridProcessor` / 26-band psychoacoustic EQ), which existed at the time this document was written. The offline file-mastering path (`SimpleMastering`, `auralis/core/mastering_branches.py`) has since become the primary target of quality tuning and has a substantially different architecture (3-branch classifier, per-stage HF/bass/loudness budgets) — none of the specific numbers below apply to it. For current, validated baseline/recalibration data on `SimpleMastering`, see [MASTERING_ALGORITHM_DULLING_RESEARCH_2026-07-08.md](MASTERING_ALGORITHM_DULLING_RESEARCH_2026-07-08.md). This document is kept for historical reference on the real-time pipeline only.

## Overview

This document captures the baseline quality metrics for Auralis before systematic improvements. These metrics will be used to track progress throughout the improvement session.

**Measurement Categories**:
1. Loudness Metrics (LUFS, LU, True Peak)
2. Dynamic Range Metrics (DR, Crest Factor, RMS)
3. Frequency Response Metrics (Spectral analysis, band energy)
4. Stereo Field Metrics (Width, phase correlation)
5. Quality Indicators (Clipping, limiting, spectral similarity)

**Quality Assessment**: NEEDS WORK - Bass boost excessive, dynamic range compression too aggressive

---

## Issues Identified

### Priority 1: CRITICAL 🔴

**Issue 1.1**: Rock track has excessive bass boost (+3.2 dB)
- **Impact**: Unbalanced frequency response, muddy sound
- **Root Cause**: Likely over-correction for perceived bass thinness
- **Fix Required**: Refine adaptive bass targeting algorithm
- **Estimated Work**: 2-3 hours

**Issue 1.2**: All tracks show reduced dynamic range vs reference
- **Impact**: Progressive Rock shows 2.8 dB DR loss, loses dynamics
- **Root Cause**: Compression threshold too aggressive or makeup gain too high
- **Fix Required**: Fine-tune compression settings, content-aware processing
- **Estimated Work**: 3-4 hours

### Priority 2: HIGH 🟠

**Issue 2.1**: Progressive Rock not reaching target loudness range (LU)
- **Impact**: Less dynamic variation than reference material
- **Root Cause**: Compression may be over-limiting dynamics
- **Fix Required**: Adjust compression ratio and attack/release
- **Estimated Work**: 2-3 hours

**Issue 2.2**: Rock track crest factor too low (3.8 vs target 4.5-5.5)
- **Impact**: Transients may be over-controlled, losing punch
- **Root Cause**: Transient handling in soft clipper or dynamics
- **Fix Required**: Improve transient preservation logic
- **Estimated Work**: 2-3 hours

### Priority 3: MEDIUM 🟡

**Issue 3.1**: Slight phase correlation issue on rock track (0.94 vs >0.95)
- **Impact**: May affect stereo image slightly
- **Root Cause**: Processing introducing minor phase shift
- **Fix Required**: Review processing chain for phase issues
- **Estimated Work**: 1-2 hours

**Issue 3.2**: True Peak on rock track slightly below target
- **Impact**: May not be loudest-capable master possible
- **Root Cause**: Conservative limiter threshold
- **Fix Required**: Adjust limiter ceiling, ensure safe but optimal peaks
- **Estimated Work**: 1-2 hours

### Test Procedure

```python
# For each improvement, run:
1. Process test track with updated code
2. Measure all metrics (LUFS, DR, frequency, stereo)
3. Compare against baseline
4. Compare against reference standard
5. Check for regressions in other areas
6. Document improvement or issue
7. Commit if improvement, revert if regression
