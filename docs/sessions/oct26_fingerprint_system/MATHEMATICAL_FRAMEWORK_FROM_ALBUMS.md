## Critical Mathematical Discoveries

### 1. **LUFS Variation is NATURAL and INTENTIONAL**

```
LUFS Range Across Albums:

Steven Wilson (Hand.):      20.5 dB  (track 11: -42.2, track 6: -21.7)
Alan Parsons (Raven):       17.1 dB  (track 6: -29.7, track 1: -12.6)
Metallica S&M:              14.6 dB  (intro: -23.4, metal: -8.8)
Fito Páez:                  10.1 dB  (track 13: -22.2, track 7: -12.1)
deadmau5:                    9.6 dB  (piano: -14.1, loud: -4.5)

Average variation: 14.4 dB
```

**Principle 1: DO NOT normalize loudness across tracks**
- Natural music has 10-20 dB LUFS variation within albums
- Even electronic music shows 9.6 dB variation
- Quiet tracks are SUPPOSED to be quiet

### 2. **Crest Factor Shows TIGHT Consistency**

```
Crest Factor Standard Deviation:

Steven Wilson (Hand.):      ±2.5 dB  (mean: 20.6, range: 9.2)
Alan Parsons (Raven):       ±2.3 dB  (mean: 19.0, range: 6.8)
Metallica S&M:              ±2.5 dB  (mean: 16.1, range: 8.9)
Fito Páez:                  ±2.2 dB  (mean: 16.8, range: 8.1)
deadmau5:                   ±2.4 dB  (mean: 11.3, range: 9.6)

Average std dev: ±2.4 dB
```

**Principle 2: PRESERVE dynamic range capability (crest factor)**
- Crest factor stays within ±2-3 dB across tracks
- This is what's ACTUALLY consistent in good mastering
- Focus: maintain the "ability to be dynamic", not "actual loudness"

### 3. **LUFS ↔ Bass/Mid Ratio Correlation**

```
Correlation Coefficients:

Alan Parsons (Raven):    +0.974  (nearly perfect!)
deadmau5:                +0.707  (strong)
Metallica S&M:           Visible pattern (orchestra: -4.5, metal: +2 to +7)

LUFS ↔ Crest:
deadmau5:                -1.000  (perfect inverse)
Alan Parsons:            -0.579  (moderate inverse)
S&M:                     Natural relationship
```

**Principle 3: PRESERVE natural LUFS ↔ Frequency correlations**
- Louder sections naturally have more bass
- Quieter sections naturally have more mids
- This is PHYSICS, not a mastering choice
- Heavy music = bass-forward, Acoustic/vocals = mid-dominant

### 4. **Mid-Dominance is RARE and VALUABLE**

```
Bass/Mid Ratio Across Albums:

AC/DC (classic rock):       -3.4 dB  (66.9% mid - RARE!)
Fito Páez (average):        -3.3 dB  (mid-dominant)
Metallica (orchestra):      -4.5 dB  (classical instruments)

Steven Wilson (average):    +1.0 dB  (varies wildly: -6.7 to +7.2)
deadmau5 (average):        +10.4 dB  (98.7% bass on some tracks!)

Only ~15% of analyzed tracks are mid-dominant (B/M < 0)
```

**Principle 4: When detected, PRESERVE mid-dominance**
- Negative B/M ratio is rare classic sound
- Found in: analog era, acoustic sections, orchestral
- Modern production is overwhelmingly bass-forward (+3 to +10 dB)

## What We Should NOT Do

### ❌ Wrong Approach 1: Loudness Normalization
```python
# WRONG - kills natural variation
for track in album:
    normalize_to_target_lufs(-14.0)  # Forces consistency that shouldn't exist
```

**Why wrong:** Steven Wilson varies 20.5 dB, Alan Parsons 17.1 dB, Metallica 14.6 dB
**Reality:** Natural music has massive loudness variation

### ❌ Wrong Approach 2: Fixed Frequency Balance
```python
# WRONG - fights natural relationships
for track in album:
    force_bass_mid_ratio(+2.0)  # Same for all tracks
```

**Why wrong:** Natural music correlates frequency with loudness (r=+0.974)
**Reality:** Loud sections are bass-heavy, quiet sections are mid-dominant

### ❌ Wrong Approach 3: Aggressive De-mastering Everything
```python
# WRONG - assumes all music is over-compressed
for track in album:
    restore_dynamics_to_18_db_crest()  # Fixed target
```

**Why wrong:**
- Electronic music: 11.3 dB crest is INTENTIONAL design
- Some tracks already excellent (22.8 dB crest - leave them alone!)
- Fito Páez: 16.8 dB average is already good

---

## What We SHOULD Do

### ✅ Correct Approach 1: Preserve LUFS Variation, Improve Crest Consistency

```python
def process_album(tracks):
    """
    Process album while preserving natural loudness variation.
    Focus: Improve dynamic range capability (crest), NOT normalize loudness.
    """

    # Measure album characteristics
    source_lufs = [track.lufs for track in tracks]
    source_crest = [track.crest for track in tracks]

    # Calculate album-wide targets
    album_crest_target = compute_optimal_crest_for_album(tracks)

    for track in tracks:
        # PRESERVE relative loudness
        # Calculate where this track sits in the album's loudness range
        lufs_percentile = get_percentile(track.lufs, source_lufs)

        # Improve crest factor toward album target
        if track.crest < album_crest_target - 2:
            # This track is more compressed than album average - restore
            crest_improvement = (album_crest_target - track.crest) * 0.5
            target_crest = track.crest + crest_improvement
        elif track.crest > album_crest_target + 3:
            # This track already exceptional - minimal change
            target_crest = track.crest + 0.5
        else:
            # Close to album average - gentle improvement
            target_crest = album_crest_target

        # Target LUFS based on relative position (PRESERVE variation!)
        # Don't use absolute target, use RELATIVE position
        target_lufs = track.lufs - (target_crest - track.crest) * 0.5
        # Louder crest means we can afford slightly quieter LUFS

        process_track(track, target_lufs, target_crest)
```

**Key:** Maintain the **shape** of the loudness curve across the album

### ✅ Correct Approach 2: Preserve Natural Frequency-Loudness Correlation

```python
def preserve_natural_frequency_balance(track, target_lufs, source_lufs):
    """
    Preserve the natural correlation between loudness and frequency balance.

    Discovery: LUFS ↔ Bass/Mid correlation = +0.974 (Alan Parsons)
    Meaning: Louder tracks naturally have more bass
    """

    # Calculate LUFS change
    lufs_delta = target_lufs - source_lufs

    # Estimate natural bass/mid change that should accompany LUFS change
    # Based on observed correlation
    natural_bass_mid_shift = lufs_delta * 0.3  # Empirical from data

    # If we're reducing LUFS by 3 dB, bass should reduce ~0.9 dB relative to mids
    # This maintains the natural relationship

    # DON'T force a target B/M ratio
    # DO adjust proportionally with loudness change

    target_bass_mid = track.source_bass_mid + natural_bass_mid_shift

    return target_bass_mid
```

### ✅ Correct Approach 3: Track-Specific Processing Based on Source Quality

```python
def determine_processing_intensity(track):
    """
    Processing intensity based on current quality, not genre/style.
    """

    if track.crest > 19:
        # Already audiophile quality (like Steven Wilson, Metallica intro)
        return {
            'intensity': 0.1,  # Minimal
            'approach': 'preserve',
            'target_crest': track.crest + 0.5,  # Gentle enhancement
            'preserve_character': 0.95  # 95% source
        }

    elif track.crest < 11:
        # Heavily compressed (like deadmau5 loud tracks)
        # CHECK: Is this electronic music where it's intentional?
        if is_electronic_music(track):  # High bass %, synthetic characteristics
            return {
                'intensity': 0.3,  # Moderate - respect artistic choice
                'approach': 'gentle_restoration',
                'target_crest': min(track.crest + 3.0, 14.0),  # Don't go crazy
                'preserve_character': 0.8  # Mostly preserve
            }
        else:
            # Acoustic music that's been crushed - restore more aggressively
            return {
                'intensity': 0.6,  # Stronger restoration
                'approach': 'dynamics_restoration',
                'target_crest': min(track.crest + 5.0, 17.0),
                'preserve_character': 0.6
            }

    else:
        # Moderate quality (12-19 dB crest)
        # Like Fito Páez average (16.8 dB)
        return {
            'intensity': 0.4,
            'approach': 'balanced_enhancement',
            'target_crest': min(track.crest + 2.0, 17.0),
            'preserve_character': 0.75
        }
```

## The Complete Algorithm

### Step 1: Album-Level Analysis

```python
def analyze_album(tracks):
    """Analyze entire album to understand natural variation."""

    lufs_values = [t.lufs for t in tracks]
    crest_values = [t.crest for t in tracks]
    bass_mid_values = [t.bass_mid_ratio for t in tracks]

    # Measure natural variation
    lufs_range = max(lufs_values) - min(lufs_values)
    crest_std = np.std(crest_values)

    # Detect album style
    if lufs_range > 15:
        style = 'audiophile'  # Large intentional variation
        preserve_variation = True
    elif lufs_range < 5:
        style = 'electronic_consistent'  # Tight consistency
        preserve_variation = True  # Still respect the small differences
    else:
        style = 'balanced'
        preserve_variation = True  # ALWAYS preserve variation

    # Calculate correlation
    lufs_bass_mid_corr = np.corrcoef(lufs_values, bass_mid_values)[0, 1]

    # Determine album-wide target crest
    if np.mean(crest_values) > 18:
        # Already audiophile quality
        album_target_crest = np.mean(crest_values)
    elif np.mean(crest_values) < 12:
        # Compressed - restore to moderate
        album_target_crest = 14.0  # Don't go too far
    else:
        # Aim for balanced audiophile
        album_target_crest = 16.5

    return {
        'style': style,
        'preserve_variation': True,  # ALWAYS
        'lufs_range': lufs_range,
        'target_crest': album_target_crest,
        'correlation': lufs_bass_mid_corr
    }
```

### Step 2: Track-Level Processing

```python
def process_track_in_album_context(track, album_analysis, all_tracks):
    """
    Process track maintaining its position in album's dynamic landscape.
    """

    # 1. Determine track's relative position
    all_lufs = [t.lufs for t in all_tracks]
    track_percentile = percentile_rank(track.lufs, all_lufs)
    # e.g., 20th percentile = one of quieter tracks in album

    # 2. Set crest target based on source quality
    if track.crest > 19:
        target_crest = track.crest + 0.5  # Already excellent
    elif track.crest < 11:
        improvement = (album_analysis['target_crest'] - track.crest) * 0.5
        target_crest = track.crest + improvement
    else:
        target_crest = album_analysis['target_crest']

    # 3. Calculate target LUFS maintaining relative position
    # DON'T normalize - maintain the spread
    crest_delta = target_crest - track.crest

    # Increasing crest means we can reduce LUFS slightly (more headroom)
    # This maintains the inverse relationship we observed
    target_lufs = track.lufs - (crest_delta * 0.5)

    # 4. Adjust frequency balance proportionally
    # Maintain the natural LUFS ↔ Bass/Mid correlation
    if abs(album_analysis['correlation']) > 0.7:
        # Strong correlation exists - preserve it
        lufs_change = target_lufs - track.lufs
        bass_mid_adjustment = lufs_change * 0.3  # Proportional shift
        target_bass_mid = track.bass_mid_ratio + bass_mid_adjustment
    else:
        # Weak correlation - preserve source balance
        target_bass_mid = track.bass_mid_ratio

    # 5. Special case: preserve mid-dominance
    if track.mid_pct > 50 and track.bass_mid_ratio < 0:
        target_bass_mid = track.bass_mid_ratio  # LOCK IT

    return {
        'target_lufs': target_lufs,
        'target_crest': target_crest,
        'target_bass_mid': target_bass_mid,
        'preserve_percentile': track_percentile,
        'intensity': calculate_intensity(track, target_crest, target_lufs)
    }
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement this framework** in ContinuousTargetGenerator
2. **Replace current heuristics** with data-driven relationships
3. **Test on all analyzed albums** - should produce minimal changes to already-good tracks
4. **Validate correlations are preserved** after processing

*This is the math the music told us to use.*
