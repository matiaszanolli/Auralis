# Beta.7 Development Session - October 30, 2025

**Focus**: Fix preset switching slowness and plan MSE migration
**Duration**: ~4 hours
**Status**: Planning complete, ready for implementation

---

## üêõ **Problem Identified**

### User Report
"Changing presets is insanely slow. Something is not right or the mastering process is taking way longer than usual."

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue**: Multi-tier buffer system completely bypassed by frontend

**Discovery**:
1. Frontend calls `/api/player/stream/{track_id}?enhanced=true&preset=warm&intensity=1`
2. This endpoint processes **ALL chunks** (e.g., 9 chunks √ó 30s = 270s audio)
3. Multi-tier buffer system exists but is never consulted
4. Preset switching takes 2-5 seconds (should be < 100ms)

**Why This Happened**:
- Beta.4 (Oct 27) implemented MSE backend streaming
- Frontend was never migrated to use MSE
- Still using HTML5 `<audio src={url}>` approach
- Beta.4 documentation claimed "67% code reduction" but frontend wasn't updated

---

## üîç **Investigation Steps**

### 1. Backend Logs Analysis
Discovered backend was processing all chunks on every preset change:
```
INFO:routers.player:Starting chunked processing for track 9730 (preset: warm, intensity: 1.0)
INFO:chunked_processor:ChunkedAudioProcessor initialized: track_id=9730, duration=269.9s, chunks=9
```

### 2. Code Review
- `/api/player/stream/` still uses old full-file processing
- `/api/unified_streaming/` and `/api/mse_streaming/` endpoints exist but unused
- Multi-tier buffer worker running but no requests hitting it

### 3. Attempted Fixes
**Attempt 1**: Redirect `/api/player/stream/` to unified streaming
- **Result**: Import errors, CORS issues
- **Problem**: Trying to serve chunks to HTML5 audio (needs full files)

**Attempt 2**: Optimize current system with better caching
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Working
- **Implementation**: Check for cached full files first, skip reprocessing
- **Performance**: First switch ~2-5s, subsequent < 1s if cached

---

## ‚úÖ **Quick Fix Applied (Beta.7 Hotfix)**

### Changes Made
**File**: `auralis-web/backend/routers/player.py`

```python
# Before: Always processed all chunks
if enhanced:
    processor = ChunkedAudioProcessor(...)
    file_to_serve = processor.get_full_processed_audio_path()  # Slow!

# After: Check cache first
if enhanced:
    processor = ChunkedAudioProcessor(...)
    full_path = processor.chunk_dir / f"track_{track_id}_{config_hash}_{preset}_{intensity}_full.wav"

    if full_path.exists():
        # INSTANT! Use cached file
        logger.info(f"‚ö° INSTANT: Serving cached full file for preset '{preset}'")
        file_to_serve = str(full_path)
    else:
        # Process only if needed
        file_to_serve = processor.get_full_processed_audio_path()
```

### Results
- ‚úÖ First preset switch: Still 2-5s (must process)
- ‚úÖ Subsequent switches: < 1s (if cached from proactive buffering)
- ‚úÖ Proactive buffering: Other presets pre-processed in background
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still not using multi-tier buffer (needs MSE frontend)

---

## üìä **Current System Architecture**

### What We Have (All Complete!)

1. **25D Audio Fingerprint System** ‚úÖ
   - 7 analyzers extracting 25 dimensions
   - Integrated into HybridProcessor
   - See: `docs/sessions/oct26_fingerprint_system/`

2. **.25d Sidecar Files** ‚úÖ
   - 5,251x speedup for fingerprint loading
   - JSON format (1.35 KB per file)
   - SidecarManager class (342 lines)
   - Production ready since Beta.6
   - See: `25D_SIDECAR_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

3. **MSE Backend Streaming** ‚úÖ
   - `/api/mse_streaming/chunk/{track_id}/{chunk_idx}`
   - `/api/unified_streaming/chunk/`
   - WebM/Opus encoding pipeline
   - See: Beta.4 implementation

4. **Multi-Tier Buffer System** ‚úÖ
   - L1 Cache (18 MB): Current + next chunk, high-prob presets
   - L2 Cache (36 MB): Branch scenarios, predicted switches
   - L3 Cache (45 MB): Long-term section cache
   - Branch predictor learns user patterns
   - See: `auralis-web/backend/multi_tier_buffer.py` (765 lines)

### What's Missing

1. **MSE Frontend Integration** ‚ùå
   - Frontend still uses HTML5 `<audio src={url}>`
   - No progressive chunk loading
   - Multi-tier buffer completely bypassed

---

## üéØ **The Plan: MSE Frontend Migration**

### Implementation Roadmap
Created: `BETA7_MSE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

**5 Phases** (16-24 hours total):

1. **MSE Setup** (4-6 hours)
   - Create `useMSEController.ts` hook
   - Initialize MediaSource + SourceBuffer
   - Replace `<audio src={url}>` with MSE

2. **Progressive Loading** (4-6 hours)
   - Load first chunk immediately (< 100ms playback start)
   - Prefetch next 2 chunks in background
   - Continuous buffering during playback

3. **Preset Switching** (4-6 hours)
   - Clear buffer on preset change
   - Load new preset chunk at current position
   - Resume playback instantly
   - Multi-tier buffer automatically consulted

4. **Error Handling** (2-4 hours)
   - Buffer state management
   - Seek handling
   - Network error recovery

5. **Testing** (2-4 hours)
   - Unit tests for MSE controller
   - Integration tests with backend
   - Performance benchmarks

### Expected Results
- ‚ö° Preset switch (L1 cached): < 100ms
- ‚ö° Preset switch (L2 cached): 100-200ms
- ‚ö° Preset switch (uncached): 500ms-2s
- ‚ö° Playback start: < 100ms (first chunk only)

## üìù **Key Discoveries**

### 1. Foundation is 95% Complete
All the hard backend work is done:
- ‚úÖ 25D fingerprint system
- ‚úÖ .25d sidecar caching (5,251x speedup)
- ‚úÖ MSE backend streaming
- ‚úÖ Multi-tier buffer with branch prediction
- ‚úÖ Chunked processing (30s chunks, 3s crossfade)

**Only missing**: MSE frontend integration

### 2. Beta.4 "Unified Streaming" Was Incomplete
Beta.4 claimed:
- "67% player UI code reduction (970‚Üí320 lines)"
- "Unified MSE + Multi-Tier Buffer system"

**Reality**:
- Backend was implemented
- Frontend was never migrated
- Old player code still in use

### 3. .25d Sidecar Files Already Production-Ready
Discovered `25D_SIDECAR_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`:
- Shipped in Beta.6 (Oct 29, 2025)
- 5,251x performance improvement
- Portable metadata format
- Automatic cache detection
- This was a MAJOR feature we almost forgot about!

## üöÄ **Next Steps for Beta.7**

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ‚úÖ Document current state (this file)
2. ‚úÖ Create MSE migration plan
3. ‚úÖ Update Beta.8 roadmap to Beta.7 roadmap

## üéì **Lessons Learned**

1. **Always verify "complete" features**
   - Beta.4 claimed unified streaming was done
   - Only backend was implemented
   - Frontend migration was missed

2. **Document what exists before building**
   - .25d sidecar files were already production-ready
   - Almost duplicated work in Beta.8 roadmap
   - Need better knowledge management

3. **User feedback is critical**
   - "Preset switching is slow" revealed multi-tier buffer not being used
   - Without this, we might have shipped Beta.7 with unused backend

4. **Quick fixes buy time for proper solutions**
   - Cached file approach improved UX immediately
   - Allows proper MSE migration without rushing
