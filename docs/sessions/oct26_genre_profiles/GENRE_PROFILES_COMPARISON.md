**Original 1995**:
- Bass: 68.7%, Mid: 29.1%, High: 2.2%
- B/M: +3.7 dB, H/M: -11.2 dB
- **Very dark** (only 2.2% high energy)

**Changes**:
- ✓ **Dramatic high-frequency restoration** (+5.7 dB ratio change) - **HUGE IMPROVEMENT**
- ✓ Reduced excessive bass bloat
- ✓ Restored midrange clarity
- ✓ **Undid loudness war compression artifacts**

---

## Why Remasters Sound Better

Based on the frequency analysis, the "audio quality increase" user mentioned comes from:

### 1. High-Frequency Restoration (+4 to +6 dB)
- Original 1990s/2000s masters were **very dark** (2-2.4% high energy)
- 2018 remasters added **extended treble** (5-10% high energy)
- Creates clarity, air, detail, "modern" sound
- **This is the #1 improvement factor**

### 2. Bass Optimization
- 1995 album: Enhanced bass power (good for metal)
- 2002 album: Reduced bass bloat (better balance)
- Content-aware adjustment based on original

### 3. Midrange Clarity
- Modest midrange adjustments
- Created space without over-scooping
- Vocal presence maintained

## Implications for Auralis Adaptive Processing

### Genre Detection → Profile Selection

```python
def select_reference_profile(genre):
    if genre in ['Progressive Rock', 'Art Rock', 'Prog Metal']:
        return steven_wilson_profile
        # 52% bass, 42% mid, 5% high
        # Target: -18 to -14 LUFS

    elif genre in ['Power Metal', 'Speed Metal', 'Heavy Metal']:
        return blind_guardian_profile
        # 65% bass, 27% mid, 7% high
        # Target: -16 to -14 LUFS

    # ... more genres
```

---

### Frequency Matching Strategy

**For Power Metal Input**:
```python
# Current frequency response
current = analyze_frequency(audio)

# Target: Blind Guardian 2018 profile
target_bass_to_mid = +3.8  # Heavy bass
target_high_to_mid = -5.8  # Bright but controlled

# Calculate EQ corrections
bass_correction = target_bass_to_mid - current['bass_to_mid']
high_correction = target_high_to_mid - current['high_to_mid']

# Apply frequency matching
if current['high_pct'] < 5:  # Very dark original
    high_correction += 3.0  # Extra high-frequency restoration

apply_eq(audio, bass_correction, high_correction)
```

---

### Dynamic Range Targets by Genre

| Genre | Target LUFS | Target Crest Factor | Philosophy |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Progressive Rock** | -18 to -14 | 15-18 dB | Maximum dynamics, audiophile |
| **Power Metal** | -16 to -14 | 14-16 dB | Powerful but dynamic |
| **Pop** (TBD) | -14 to -11 | 10-12 dB | Louder, more compressed |
| **Jazz** (TBD) | -20 to -16 | 18-20 dB | Natural, live dynamics |

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Frequency Matching on Blind Guardian

**Validation Test**:
- Take original 1995 "Imaginations" track
- Apply Auralis frequency matching to 2018 remaster profile
- Compare result to actual 2018 remaster
- Measure: Spectral similarity, A/B listening test

**Expected Result**: Auralis should achieve similar high-frequency restoration and balance improvements

---

### 2. Add More Genre Profiles

**High Priority**:
- Pop (Quincy Jones) - Tight, punchy, commercial
- Rock/Grunge (Andy Wallace) - Raw, powerful
- Modern Metal (Jens Bogren) - Tight, aggressive

**Medium Priority**:
- Electronic (Daft Punk/Thomas Bangalter) - Wide range
- Jazz (Rudy Van Gelder) - Natural, transparent

---

### 3. Implement Multi-Genre System

```python
class AdaptiveMasteringEngine:
    def process(self, audio, sr):
        # Detect genre
        genre = self.detect_genre(audio, sr)

        # Select reference profile
        if genre == 'Progressive Rock':
            profile = steven_wilson_profile
        elif genre == 'Power Metal':
            profile = blind_guardian_profile
        # ... etc

        # Match frequency response
        self.match_spectral_balance(audio, profile)

        # Apply dynamics processing
        self.apply_dynamics(audio, profile.target_crest_factor)

        return audio
```

---

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Genre Matters - Spectral Balance Varies Significantly

Progressive Rock vs Power Metal:
- **+13% more bass** in power metal
- **-15% less mids** in power metal
- **+2% more highs** in power metal
- **+2.9 dB heavier bass-to-mid ratio**

**Conclusion**: Cannot use one-size-fits-all frequency target. Must adapt to genre.

---

### 2. High-Frequency Restoration is Key to Quality Improvement

Both Blind Guardian remasters showed:
- Original: 2-2.4% high energy (very dark)
- Remaster: 5-10% high energy (much brighter)
- **Change: +4 to +6 dB high-frequency boost**

**Conclusion**: Dark 1990s/2000s masters need significant high-frequency restoration. This is likely the #1 factor in "audio quality increase."

---

### 3. Content-Aware Processing Confirmed (Again)

2018 remasters used different strategies:
- 1995 album: Enhanced bass, added highs
- 2002 album: Reduced bass, dramatically added highs
- Both ended at similar spectral balance

**Conclusion**: Professional remasters adapt processing based on original characteristics, but target the same genre-appropriate spectral balance.

---

### 4. Two Solid Genre References Established

✅ **Progressive Rock** (Steven Wilson)
- 52% bass, 42% mid, 5% high
- +0.9 dB B/M, -8.9 dB H/M
- -18.3 LUFS, 18.45 dB crest

✅ **Power Metal** (Blind Guardian 2018)
- 65% bass, 27% mid, 7% high
- +3.8 dB B/M, -5.8 dB H/M
- ~-16 LUFS, ~16 dB crest

**Ready for implementation**: Can now build adaptive system that handles two distinct genres with confidence.
