## Steven Wilson Mastering Profile - Key Findings

### Loudness Philosophy
- **Est. LUFS**: -18.3 LUFS (moderate, not maximally loud)
- **RMS**: -19.02 dB
- **Peak**: -0.57 dB
- **Philosophy**: Quality and dynamics > raw volume

### Dynamic Range Excellence
- **Crest Factor**: **18.45 dB** (exceptional!)
- **Rating**: Exceeds audiophile standard (DR12-14)
- **Approach**: Preserved transients, soft limiting, no brick-wall
- **Key**: "Punch" from dynamics, not from RMS

### Frequency Balance Signature
- **Bass** (20-250 Hz): 52.3% energy (+0.9 dB to mids)
- **Mid** (250-4k Hz): 42.3% energy (reference)
- **High** (4k-20k Hz): 5.4% energy (-8.9 dB to mids)
- **Extension**: 25 Hz - 20 kHz (full-range audiophile)
- **Character**: Warmth and body, extended air, no harshness

### Stereo Field Approach
- **Stereo Width**: 0.184 (moderate, natural)
- **Correlation**: 0.633 (mono-compatible)
- **Philosophy**: Real stereo depth, not artificial width

## Critical Discovery Confirmed

**Frequency Response Matching > Loudness Normalization**

The Porcupine Tree reference analysis confirms our discovery:

1. **Steven Wilson's Standard**: -18.3 LUFS (intentionally below streaming standards)
2. **Matchering's Queensrÿche Strategy**: Preserved/enhanced DR (113.8%), minimal RMS change (-0.97 dB)
3. **Conclusion**: Matchering matches **spectral balance** (52% bass, 42% mid, 5% high), not absolute loudness

**Key Insight**: Professional mastering is about matching the **frequency response curve** and **dynamic range profile**, not forcing tracks to a specific RMS/LUFS target.

---

## Implementation Targets for Auralis

### Must Match (Primary Targets)

1. **Frequency Response**:
   - Bass extension to 35 Hz
   - Bass-to-Mid ratio: +0.5 to +1.5 dB
   - High-to-Mid ratio: -8 to -10 dB
   - No scooped mids, no harsh treble

2. **Dynamic Range**:
   - Minimum crest factor: 12 dB (target: 15-18 dB)
   - Soft, transparent limiting only
   - Preserve transients

3. **Stereo Field**:
   - Width: 0.6-0.8 (natural, not hyper-wide)
   - L-R correlation: > 0.5 (mono-compatible)

### Content-Aware (Secondary Targets)

1. **Well-Mastered Albums** (like Queensrÿche):
   - Target: -18 to -16 LUFS (Steven Wilson approach)
   - Strategy: Conservative frequency matching
   - Allow RMS variation
   - Allow DR enhancement (>100%)

2. **Poorly-Mastered Albums** (like The Cure):
   - Target: -14 to -12 LUFS (streaming standards)
   - Strategy: Aggressive RMS normalization + frequency matching
   - Consistent RMS across tracks
   - DR preservation ≥85%

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Validate Matchering The Cure Results (NEEDED)
**Action**: Measure The Cure crest factor changes
**Goal**: Determine if The Cure also showed DR enhancement or compression
**Time**: 1 hour

```bash
python scripts/analyze_the_cure_crest_factor.py
```

**Key Question**: Did The Cure also expand DR like Queensrÿche, or did Matchering compress it to reach -12.05 dB RMS?

---

### 2. Process Albums with Current Auralis (BASELINE)
**Action**: Generate baseline before implementing changes
**Time**: 3-4 hours

```bash
# The Cure - Wish
python scripts/batch_process_auralis.py \
  --input "The Cure - Wish/" \
  --output "auralis_baseline/the_cure/" \
  --preset adaptive \
  --genre alternative_rock

# Queensrÿche - Operation: Mindcrime
python scripts/batch_process_auralis.py \
  --input "Queensrÿche - Operation Mindcrime/" \
  --output "auralis_baseline/queensryche/" \
  --preset adaptive \
  --genre progressive_metal
```

---

### 3. Implement Frequency Response Analyzer (DEVELOPMENT)
**Action**: Build tool to extract current frequency response
**Time**: 4-6 hours

**Create**: `auralis/learning/spectrum_profiler.py`

```python
class SpectrumProfiler:
    def extract_frequency_profile(self, audio, sr):
        """Extract 1/3 octave bands, bass/mid/high ratios"""
        # Same analysis as Steven Wilson reference
        pass

    def compare_to_reference(self, audio_profile, reference_profile):
        """Calculate EQ corrections needed"""
        # Compare band by band
        # Generate corrective EQ curve
        pass
```

---

### 4. Prototype Frequency Matching EQ (PROOF OF CONCEPT)
**Action**: Test frequency matching on Queensrÿche
**Time**: 6-8 hours

**Goal**: Validate that spectral matching creates improvement

```python
# Load Queensrÿche original
audio, sr = load_audio("Queensrÿche - Revolution Calling.flac")

# Extract current profile
current = SpectrumProfiler().extract_frequency_profile(audio, sr)

# Load Steven Wilson reference profile
with open("profiles/steven_wilson_prodigal_2021.json") as f:
    reference = json.load(f)

# Calculate EQ corrections
eq_curve = calculate_eq_corrections(current, reference)

# Apply EQ
processed = apply_eq_curve(audio, eq_curve, sr)

# Compare results
print(f"Bass-to-Mid: {current['bass_to_mid_db']:.1f} dB → {reference['frequency_response']['bass_to_mid_db']:.1f} dB")
print(f"High-to-Mid: {current['high_to_mid_db']:.1f} dB → {reference['frequency_response']['high_to_mid_db']:.1f} dB")
```

---

### 5. Implement Content-Aware Processing Strategy (CRITICAL)
**Action**: Detect input quality and choose strategy
**Time**: 1 week

```python
class QualityDetector:
    def assess_input_quality(self, audio, sr):
        """Determine if well-mastered or poorly-mastered"""
        # Check RMS levels
        # Check dynamic range
        # Check frequency response
        # Return quality score (0-1)

class AdaptiveProcessor:
    def process(self, audio, sr):
        quality = QualityDetector().assess_input_quality(audio, sr)

        if quality > 0.7:  # Well-mastered
            strategy = "conservative_frequency_matching"
            target_lufs = -18.0  # Steven Wilson approach
            allow_dr_enhancement = True
        else:  # Poorly-mastered
            strategy = "aggressive_normalization"
            target_lufs = -14.0  # Streaming standards
            allow_dr_enhancement = False

        # Process accordingly
```

## Philosophy Alignment

User's stated goal:
> "Auralis's goal is to do studio-level mastering without requiring references, but we have to compare and improve constantly against the best on each genre (Steven Wilson, Butch Vig, Quincy Jones between others) to know we're reaching THEIR standards."

**This session delivers**:
✅ Steven Wilson's mastering profile extracted (the best in progressive rock)
✅ Validation framework to compare against masters
✅ Critical insight: frequency response matching > loudness
✅ Clear targets for Auralis development
✅ Path to studio-level mastering without requiring references

**Key Principle**: *"Learn from the masters to become a master."*

We've learned from Steven Wilson. Now we implement.

## Conclusion

**Session Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Steven Wilson Profile Extracted ✅

**Key Accomplishment**: We now have the **definitive reference standard** for progressive rock mastering, extracted directly from Steven Wilson's 2021 remaster of Porcupine Tree's "Prodigal."

**Critical Discovery**: Professional mastering is about **frequency response matching** (52% bass, 42% mid, 5% high) and **dynamic range preservation** (18.45 dB crest factor), not about forcing tracks to a specific LUFS target.

**Next Action**: Implement frequency matching in Auralis using the Steven Wilson profile as the reference standard.

**Impact**: This session provides both the **validation framework** AND the **reference standard** needed to achieve studio-level mastering quality in Auralis.
