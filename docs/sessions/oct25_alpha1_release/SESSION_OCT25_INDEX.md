### What Was Accomplished
1. ‚úÖ Implemented semantic versioning system (1.0.0-alpha.1)
2. ‚úÖ Built Linux desktop binaries (AppImage + .deb)
3. ‚úÖ Fixed 3 critical bugs blocking desktop usage
4. ‚úÖ Validated working POC with user testing

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### 1. Gain Pumping Bug (P0 - Critical)

**Impact**: All real-time mastering users
**Fix**: Replaced with proper `AdaptiveCompressor` with envelope tracking
**Files**: `auralis/player/realtime/auto_master.py`
**Documentation**: [GAIN_PUMPING_FIX.md](GAIN_PUMPING_FIX.md)

### 2. Electron Window Not Showing (P1 - High)
**Symptom**: Backend starts successfully, but no UI window appears
**Root Cause**: `ready-to-show` event doesn't fire on Linux/Wayland
**Impact**: All Linux desktop users (especially Wayland)
**Fix**: Added 2-second timeout fallback to force-show window
**Files**: `desktop/main.js`
**Documentation**: [ELECTRON_WINDOW_FIX.md](ELECTRON_WINDOW_FIX.md)

### 3. Harsh Limiter (P1 - High)
**Symptom**: Fuzzy "damaged speaker" distortion on peaks
**Root Cause**: Brick-wall limiter with no attack/release
**Impact**: All real-time mastering users
**Fix**: Replaced with tanh() soft saturation (previous session)
**Files**: `auralis/player/realtime/processor.py`
**Documentation**: Mentioned in [GAIN_PUMPING_FIX.md](GAIN_PUMPING_FIX.md)

## üéì Technical Lessons Learned

### Audio Processing
1. **Never use stateless compression in chunk-based processing**
   - Always maintain envelope state between chunks
   - Compression needs attack/release times
   - See: [GAIN_PUMPING_FIX.md](GAIN_PUMPING_FIX.md)

2. **Inverse relationships are usually wrong**
   - Lower RMS should NOT trigger more compression
   - Always validate compression curves with real audio

3. **Symptoms indicate root cause**
   - "Works for 30s then breaks" = state accumulation
   - "Fuzzy after mastering on" = improper limiting/compression

### Desktop Development
1. **Electron events are unreliable on Linux**
   - `ready-to-show` doesn't fire on some window managers
   - Always add timeout fallbacks for critical events
   - See: [ELECTRON_WINDOW_FIX.md](ELECTRON_WINDOW_FIX.md)

2. **Test on target platform early**
   - Desktop builds surface platform-specific issues
   - Can't catch these in web-only testing

### Version Management
1. **Single source of truth prevents drift**
   - `auralis/version.py` is the only version source
   - Automated sync prevents manual errors
   - See: [VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md](VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md)
