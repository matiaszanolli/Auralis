## Summary

**What's Working** 🎉:
- Audio playback via HTML5
- Library management
- Player controls
- Search
- WebSocket state sync

**What Needs Work** 🔧:
- Playlists (UI ready, backend needed)
- Favorites (toggle works, not persisted)
- Album art (placeholder only)
- Real-time enhancement (toggle exists, not functional)

**What's Not Started** 📋:
- Albums/Artists views
- Settings page
- Recently played
- Advanced features (gapless, crossfade, EQ)

## Conclusion

The **core music player functionality is fully implemented and working**. Audio streams from backend to frontend and plays correctly with all controls functional.

The main gaps are:
1. **Persistence features** (favorites, playlists)
