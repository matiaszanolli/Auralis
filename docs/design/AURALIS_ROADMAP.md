## üö® Phase 0: Critical Architecture Fixes (URGENT PRIORITY) - 0% Complete

**Goal**: Fix REST/WebSocket architecture mismatches causing inefficient polling
**Timeline**: 4-7 days
**Status**: URGENT - Must complete before Phase 1.5
**Impact**: Currently making 60+ HTTP requests/minute during playback
**Documentation**: [WEBSOCKET_REST_ANALYSIS.md](../../WEBSOCKET_REST_ANALYSIS.md)

### 0.1 Fix Player State WebSocket Communication (HIGH PRIORITY - 1-2 days)

**Problem Identified**:
- Frontend `usePlayerAPI` expects `player_state` and `player_update` WebSocket messages
- Backend **never sends these messages**
- Application falls back to REST polling `/api/player/status` every 1 second
- WebSocket connection exists but is unused for player state
- 60+ unnecessary HTTP requests per minute during playback

**Backend** (Option A - Recommended):
- [ ] Add `playback_started` message broadcast when play() is called
- [ ] Add `playback_paused` message broadcast when pause() is called
- [ ] Add `player_state` message broadcast after any player state change
- [ ] Send periodic `position_changed` messages during playback (every 1s)
- [ ] Ensure all player operations broadcast state updates

**OR Backend** (Option B - Simpler):
- [ ] Keep existing granular messages (`track_changed`, `volume_changed`, etc.)
- [ ] Update frontend to handle these instead of expecting `player_state`

**Frontend** (for Option A):
- [ ] Update `usePlayerAPI.ts` to handle `playback_started` and `playback_paused`
- [ ] Handle `player_state` messages with full state updates
- [ ] Remove REST polling fallback once WebSocket works
- [ ] Add error handling for WebSocket disconnection

**Frontend** (for Option B):
- [ ] Update `usePlayerAPI.ts` to handle granular messages:
  - [ ] `track_changed` - Update current track
  - [ ] `volume_changed` - Update volume
  - [ ] `position_changed` - Update current time
  - [ ] `playback_stopped` - Update playback state
  - [ ] `queue_updated` - Update queue
- [ ] Remove REST polling fallback

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] WebSocket messages update player state in real-time
- [ ] REST polling disabled (verify no polling in Network tab)
- [ ] Player state stays synchronized across UI
- [ ] No increase in latency compared to polling
- [ ] HTTP requests reduced from 60+/min to 0-5/min

**Time**: 1-2 days
**Priority**: üö® CRITICAL - Affects performance and server load

---

### 0.2 Fix EnhancedAudioPlayer WebSocket Messages (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 3-4 hours)

**Problem Identified**:
- Component expects `playback_started` and `playback_paused` messages
- Backend only sends `playback_stopped`
- May cause UI inconsistencies during play/pause

**Backend**:
- [ ] Add `playback_started` broadcast in play endpoint
- [ ] Add `playback_paused` broadcast in pause endpoint
- [ ] Ensure all player state changes broadcast appropriate messages

**Frontend**:
- [ ] Verify `EnhancedAudioPlayer` handles new messages correctly
- [ ] Test play/pause UI updates
- [ ] Add fallback for missing messages

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Component updates correctly on play/pause
- [ ] All WebSocket messages handled
- [ ] No console errors

**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

---

### 0.3 Consolidate to Single WebSocket Connection (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 2-3 days)

**Problem Identified**:
- Multiple components create separate WebSocket connections
- `usePlayerAPI` creates one connection
- `EnhancementContext` creates another via `useWebSocket` hook
- Inefficient and harder to debug

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `WebSocketContext.tsx` provider at app root
- [ ] Single WebSocket connection shared across all components
- [ ] Subscription system for specific message types
- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- [ ] Message queueing during disconnection

**Components to migrate**:
- [ ] Migrate `usePlayerAPI` to use WebSocketContext
- [ ] Migrate `EnhancementContext` to use WebSocketContext
- [ ] Migrate `MagicalApp` to use WebSocketContext
- [ ] Remove individual WebSocket creation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Only one WebSocket connection exists (verify in Network tab)
- [ ] All components receive messages correctly
- [ ] Reconnection works automatically
- [ ] Message delivery is reliable

**Time**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Improves architecture but not blocking

---

### 0.4 Standardize WebSocket Message Structure (LOW PRIORITY - 1-2 days)

**Problem Identified**:
- Messages have inconsistent structure
- Some use `{type, data}`, others use `{type, ...fields}`
- Makes parsing harder and error-prone

**Backend**:
- [ ] Enforce consistent message structure for all broadcasts:
  ```python
  {
    "type": "event_name",
    "data": {...},
    "timestamp": <unix_timestamp>
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update all `manager.broadcast()` calls to use standard structure
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions for all message types

**Frontend**:
- [ ] Update message handlers to expect standard structure
- [ ] Add TypeScript interfaces for all message types
- [ ] Validate message structure in WebSocketContext

**Documentation**:
- [ ] Create `WEBSOCKET_API.md` with all message types
- [ ] Document which REST endpoints trigger which WebSocket messages
- [ ] Include TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Add usage examples

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All messages follow same structure
- [ ] TypeScript types exist for all messages
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] No message parsing errors

**Time**: 1-2 days
**Priority**: üìù LOW - Nice to have, not blocking

---

**Phase 0 Total Time**: 4-7 days
**Phase 0 Impact**: Eliminates 60+ HTTP requests/minute, improves real-time responsiveness, reduces server load
