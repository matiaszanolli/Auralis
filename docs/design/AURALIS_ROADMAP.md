## üîß Recent Fixes & Updates (October 23, 2025)

### Critical Playback Fix ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Songs were playing for ~1 second and restarting repeatedly in an infinite loop.

**Root Cause**: Audio stream was being loaded multiple times due to WebSocket state updates triggering React re-renders, which reloaded the audio element and interrupted `play()` requests.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Guard in `playTrack`** ([usePlayerAPI.ts:296-305](../../auralis-web/frontend/src/hooks/usePlayerAPI.ts#L296-L305))
   - Prevents duplicate play requests for tracks already playing
   - Logs ignored duplicate requests for debugging

2. **Enhanced Stream Reload Protection** ([BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx:180-188](../../auralis-web/frontend/src/components/BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx#L180-L188))
   - Additional guard prevents audio element reload when same track/settings already loaded
   - Checks both URL match and track ID match

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Playback is now stable and continuous
- ‚úÖ No more audio restart loops
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of duplicate click attempts
- ‚úÖ Console shows clear debug messages

**Documentation**: [PLAYBACK_FIX_APPLIED.md](../../PLAYBACK_FIX_APPLIED.md)

---

### Playlist Repository Fix ‚úÖ
**Issue**: SQLAlchemy session error when fetching playlists: "Parent instance is not bound to a Session; lazy load operation cannot proceed"

**Fix**: Added eager loading in `PlaylistRepository.get_all()` using `selectinload(Playlist.tracks)` to load tracks relationship within the session.

**File**: [auralis/library/repositories/playlist_repository.py:96-108](../../auralis/library/repositories/playlist_repository.py#L96-L108)

**Result**: Playlists now load correctly without session errors.

---

### Database Schema Migration ‚úÖ
**Status**: Automatic migration from v1 to v2 working correctly

**What Changed**:
- Database version tracking implemented
- Automatic backup before migration (`.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db`)
- Migration script execution (`migration_v001_to_v002.sql`)
- Version recorded in `schema_migrations` table

**Observed**: Backend correctly detected v1 database, created backup, and migrated to v2 on startup (October 23, 2025 at 13:25:29).

---

### Roadmap Additions ‚úÖ
Added four new features to Phase 1, Phase 4, and Phase 5:

1. **Phase 1.6**: Mastering Presets Enhancement (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY) - 5-7 days
2. **Phase 4.1**: Track Metadata Editing (HIGH PRIORITY) - 4-5 days
3. **Phase 4.2**: Smart Chunk Shaping (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - 5-7 days
4. **Phase 5.1**: Mastering Algorithm Performance Review (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY) - 7-10 days

**Documentation**: [ROADMAP_UPDATES_OCT23.md](../../ROADMAP_UPDATES_OCT23.md)

---

### Cache Integrity System ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Cached audio chunks could become stale or misassigned to different tracks when presets/files changed.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Startup Cache Clearing** ([main.py:117-127](../../auralis-web/backend/main.py#L117-L127))
   - Clears in-memory processing cache dictionary
   - Deletes all chunk files from `/tmp/auralis_chunks/` on startup
   - Prevents stale audio from previous sessions

2. **Preset Change Invalidation** ([enhancement.py:102-109](../../auralis-web/backend/routers/enhancement.py#L102-L109))
   - When preset changes (e.g., warm ‚Üí punchy), clears old preset cache entries
   - Forces reprocessing with new preset
   - Logs number of entries cleared

3. **Intensity Change Invalidation** ([enhancement.py:155-164](../../auralis-web/backend/routers/enhancement.py#L155-L164))
   - When intensity slider changes, clears old intensity cache entries
   - Forces reprocessing with new intensity value
   - Logs number of entries cleared

4. **File Signature System** ([chunked_processor.py:93-149](../../auralis-web/backend/chunked_processor.py#L93-L149))
   - Generates unique signature per file based on mtime, size, and path
   - Includes signature in cache keys: `track_id_signature_preset_intensity_chunk_index`
   - Prevents cache misassignment across track file modifications
   - Automatic invalidation when file changes

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ No stale cached audio served
- ‚úÖ Preset/intensity changes work correctly
- ‚úÖ Chunks cannot be misassigned to wrong tracks
- ‚úÖ File modifications automatically invalidate cache
- ‚úÖ Four-layer protection system

---

### Buffering State Indicators ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Play/pause button had quirky behavior during audio buffering, no visual feedback for users.

**Fix Applied** ([BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx:109-817](../../auralis-web/frontend/src/components/BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx#L109-L817)):
- Added `isBuffering` state tracking
- Audio events trigger buffering states (onLoadStart, onCanPlay, onWaiting, onPlaying)
- Play button shows spinning hourglass (‚è≥) when buffering
- Button disabled during buffering to prevent quirky clicks
- Tooltip changes to "Loading..." during buffering

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Clear visual feedback when audio is loading
- ‚úÖ Button disabled prevents double-clicks during buffering
- ‚úÖ Smooth user experience without quirky behavior

---

## üö® Phase 0: Critical Architecture Fixes (URGENT PRIORITY) - 67% Complete

**Goal**: Fix REST/WebSocket architecture mismatches causing inefficient polling
**Timeline**: 4-7 days
**Status**: Phase 0.1 ‚úÖ + Phase 0.3 ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Phase 0.2 (N/A) + Phase 0.4 (Optional) Remaining
**Impact**: ~~Currently making 60+ HTTP requests/minute during playback~~ **FIXED - Zero queue polling + Single WebSocket!**
**Documentation**: [WEBSOCKET_REST_ANALYSIS.md](../../WEBSOCKET_REST_ANALYSIS.md), [WEBSOCKET_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md](../../WEBSOCKET_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md)

### 0.1 Fix Queue Polling ‚úÖ COMPLETE (October 23, 2025)

**Problem Identified**:
- BottomPlayerBarConnected component fetched `/api/player/queue` on every state change
- useEffect triggered on `currentTrack`, `gaplessEnabled`, `crossfadeEnabled` changes
- Resulted in 15+ consecutive queue requests every few seconds
- 60+ unnecessary HTTP requests per minute during playback

**Root Cause**:
- Component used REST API polling to fetch queue for gapless/crossfade next track detection
- Queue data was ALREADY available via WebSocket in `playerState.queue`
- Duplicate data fetching - polling when WebSocket already provided the data

**Fix Applied** ([BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx:85-100, 258-272](../../auralis-web/frontend/src/components/BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx#L85-L272)):

1. **Added queue fields to usePlayerAPI destructuring**:
   ```typescript
   const {
     currentTrack,
     isPlaying,
     queue,           // ‚Üê ADDED: Queue from WebSocket
     queueIndex,      // ‚Üê ADDED: Queue index from WebSocket
     ...
   } = usePlayerAPI();
   ```

2. **Replaced REST fetch with WebSocket queue data**:
   ```typescript
   // OLD: Fetched queue via REST API
   const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8765/api/player/queue');

   // NEW: Use queue from WebSocket playerState
   const currentIndex = queueIndex || 0;
   if (currentIndex + 1 < queue.length) {
     setNextTrack(queue[currentIndex + 1]);
   }
   ```

3. **Result**: useEffect now uses WebSocket data instead of polling

**Backend Status**:
- ‚úÖ PlayerStateManager already broadcasts `player_state` with queue data
- ‚úÖ WebSocket messages sent every second during playback
- ‚úÖ Queue included in every state update
- ‚úÖ No backend changes needed!

**Acceptance Criteria**: ‚úÖ ALL MET
- [x] WebSocket messages update queue in real-time
- [x] REST queue polling eliminated (verified in Network tab)
- [x] Player state stays synchronized across UI
- [x] Zero latency increase (using existing WebSocket connection)
- [x] HTTP requests reduced from 60+/min to ~0/min during playback

**Verification**:
- Backend logs show NO `GET /api/player/queue` requests after fix
- Only POST requests when user explicitly sets queue (clicking tracks)
- Network tab shows 26 total requests vs 60+ per minute before
- Gapless/crossfade next track detection still works perfectly

**Time**: 1 hour (investigation + fix + testing)
**Priority**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Major performance improvement achieved

---

### 0.2 Fix EnhancedAudioPlayer WebSocket Messages (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 3-4 hours)
