## üîß Recent Fixes & Updates (October 23, 2025)

### Critical Playback Fix ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Songs were playing for ~1 second and restarting repeatedly in an infinite loop.

**Root Cause**: Audio stream was being loaded multiple times due to WebSocket state updates triggering React re-renders, which reloaded the audio element and interrupted `play()` requests.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Guard in `playTrack`** ([usePlayerAPI.ts:296-305](../../auralis-web/frontend/src/hooks/usePlayerAPI.ts#L296-L305))
   - Prevents duplicate play requests for tracks already playing
   - Logs ignored duplicate requests for debugging

2. **Enhanced Stream Reload Protection** ([BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx:180-188](../../auralis-web/frontend/src/components/BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx#L180-L188))
   - Additional guard prevents audio element reload when same track/settings already loaded
   - Checks both URL match and track ID match

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ Playback is now stable and continuous
- ‚úÖ No more audio restart loops
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of duplicate click attempts
- ‚úÖ Console shows clear debug messages

**Documentation**: [PLAYBACK_FIX_APPLIED.md](../../PLAYBACK_FIX_APPLIED.md)

---

### Playlist Repository Fix ‚úÖ
**Issue**: SQLAlchemy session error when fetching playlists: "Parent instance is not bound to a Session; lazy load operation cannot proceed"

**Fix**: Added eager loading in `PlaylistRepository.get_all()` using `selectinload(Playlist.tracks)` to load tracks relationship within the session.

**File**: [auralis/library/repositories/playlist_repository.py:96-108](../../auralis/library/repositories/playlist_repository.py#L96-L108)

**Result**: Playlists now load correctly without session errors.

---

### Database Schema Migration ‚úÖ
**Status**: Automatic migration from v1 to v2 working correctly

**What Changed**:
- Database version tracking implemented
- Automatic backup before migration (`.backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db`)
- Migration script execution (`migration_v001_to_v002.sql`)
- Version recorded in `schema_migrations` table

**Observed**: Backend correctly detected v1 database, created backup, and migrated to v2 on startup (October 23, 2025 at 13:25:29).

---

### Roadmap Additions ‚úÖ
Added three new features to Phase 4 and Phase 5:

1. **Phase 4.1**: Track Metadata Editing (HIGH PRIORITY) - 4-5 days
2. **Phase 4.2**: Smart Chunk Shaping (MEDIUM PRIORITY) - 5-7 days
3. **Phase 5.1**: Mastering Algorithm Performance Review (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY) - 7-10 days

**Documentation**: [ROADMAP_UPDATES_OCT23.md](../../ROADMAP_UPDATES_OCT23.md)

---

## üö® Phase 0: Critical Architecture Fixes (URGENT PRIORITY) - 0% Complete

**Goal**: Fix REST/WebSocket architecture mismatches causing inefficient polling
**Timeline**: 4-7 days
**Status**: URGENT - Must complete before Phase 1.5
**Impact**: Currently making 60+ HTTP requests/minute during playback
**Documentation**: [WEBSOCKET_REST_ANALYSIS.md](../../WEBSOCKET_REST_ANALYSIS.md)

### 0.1 Fix Player State WebSocket Communication (HIGH PRIORITY - 1-2 days)

**Problem Identified**:
- Frontend `usePlayerAPI` expects `player_state` and `player_update` WebSocket messages
- Backend **never sends these messages**
- Application falls back to REST polling `/api/player/status` every 1 second
- WebSocket connection exists but is unused for player state
- 60+ unnecessary HTTP requests per minute during playback

**Backend** (Option A - Recommended):
- [ ] Add `playback_started` message broadcast when play() is called
- [ ] Add `playback_paused` message broadcast when pause() is called
- [ ] Add `player_state` message broadcast after any player state change
- [ ] Send periodic `position_changed` messages during playback (every 1s)
- [ ] Ensure all player operations broadcast state updates

**OR Backend** (Option B - Simpler):
- [ ] Keep existing granular messages (`track_changed`, `volume_changed`, etc.)
- [ ] Update frontend to handle these instead of expecting `player_state`

**Frontend** (for Option A):
- [ ] Update `usePlayerAPI.ts` to handle `playback_started` and `playback_paused`
- [ ] Handle `player_state` messages with full state updates
- [ ] Remove REST polling fallback once WebSocket works
- [ ] Add error handling for WebSocket disconnection

**Frontend** (for Option B):
- [ ] Update `usePlayerAPI.ts` to handle granular messages:
  - [ ] `track_changed` - Update current track
  - [ ] `volume_changed` - Update volume
  - [ ] `position_changed` - Update current time
  - [ ] `playback_stopped` - Update playback state
  - [ ] `queue_updated` - Update queue
- [ ] Remove REST polling fallback

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] WebSocket messages update player state in real-time
- [ ] REST polling disabled (verify no polling in Network tab)
- [ ] Player state stays synchronized across UI
- [ ] No increase in latency compared to polling
- [ ] HTTP requests reduced from 60+/min to 0-5/min

**Time**: 1-2 days
**Priority**: üö® CRITICAL - Affects performance and server load

---

### 0.2 Fix EnhancedAudioPlayer WebSocket Messages (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 3-4 hours)

**Problem Identified**:
- Component expects `playback_started` and `playback_paused` messages
- Backend only sends `playback_stopped`
- May cause UI inconsistencies during play/pause

**Backend**:
- [ ] Add `playback_started` broadcast in play endpoint
- [ ] Add `playback_paused` broadcast in pause endpoint
- [ ] Ensure all player state changes broadcast appropriate messages

**Frontend**:
- [ ] Verify `EnhancedAudioPlayer` handles new messages correctly
- [ ] Test play/pause UI updates
- [ ] Add fallback for missing messages

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Component updates correctly on play/pause
- [ ] All WebSocket messages handled
- [ ] No console errors

**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

---

### 0.3 Consolidate to Single WebSocket Connection (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 2-3 days)

**Problem Identified**:
- Multiple components create separate WebSocket connections
- `usePlayerAPI` creates one connection
- `EnhancementContext` creates another via `useWebSocket` hook
- Inefficient and harder to debug

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Create `WebSocketContext.tsx` provider at app root
- [ ] Single WebSocket connection shared across all components
- [ ] Subscription system for specific message types
- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- [ ] Message queueing during disconnection

**Components to migrate**:
- [ ] Migrate `usePlayerAPI` to use WebSocketContext
- [ ] Migrate `EnhancementContext` to use WebSocketContext
- [ ] Migrate `MagicalApp` to use WebSocketContext
- [ ] Remove individual WebSocket creation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Only one WebSocket connection exists (verify in Network tab)
- [ ] All components receive messages correctly
- [ ] Reconnection works automatically
- [ ] Message delivery is reliable

**Time**: 2-3 days
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM - Improves architecture but not blocking

---

### 0.4 Standardize WebSocket Message Structure (LOW PRIORITY - 1-2 days)

**Problem Identified**:
- Messages have inconsistent structure
- Some use `{type, data}`, others use `{type, ...fields}`
- Makes parsing harder and error-prone

**Backend**:
- [ ] Enforce consistent message structure for all broadcasts:
  ```python
  {
    "type": "event_name",
    "data": {...},
    "timestamp": <unix_timestamp>
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update all `manager.broadcast()` calls to use standard structure
- [ ] Add TypeScript type definitions for all message types

**Frontend**:
- [ ] Update message handlers to expect standard structure
- [ ] Add TypeScript interfaces for all message types
- [ ] Validate message structure in WebSocketContext

**Documentation**:
- [ ] Create `WEBSOCKET_API.md` with all message types
- [ ] Document which REST endpoints trigger which WebSocket messages
- [ ] Include TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Add usage examples

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All messages follow same structure
- [ ] TypeScript types exist for all messages
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] No message parsing errors

**Time**: 1-2 days
**Priority**: üìù LOW - Nice to have, not blocking

**Goal**: Improve chunked streaming by using intelligent chunk boundaries based on audio content rather than fixed time intervals

**Backend**:
- [ ] Implement intelligent chunk boundary detection:
  - [ ] Analyze audio waveform for natural break points
  - [ ] Detect silent sections (below -60dB threshold)
  - [ ] Identify mood/energy transitions using RMS and spectral changes
  - [ ] Detect tempo changes and beat boundaries
  - [ ] Use onset detection for rhythmic content

- [ ] Create AdaptiveChunkShaper module:
  - [ ] `analyze_chunk_points(audio, sr, min_chunk=15s, max_chunk=45s)` - Find optimal boundaries
  - [ ] `detect_mood_changes(audio, sr)` - Identify mood/energy shifts
  - [ ] `find_silent_regions(audio, sr, threshold=-60dB)` - Locate silence
  - [ ] `align_to_beats(audio, sr, boundaries)` - Snap to beat grid (optional)

- [ ] Integrate with ChunkedAudioProcessor:
  - [ ] Replace fixed 30s chunks with adaptive boundaries
  - [ ] Ensure min chunk size (15s) for streaming efficiency
  - [ ] Ensure max chunk size (45s) to avoid memory issues
  - [ ] Maintain crossfade compatibility at boundaries

- [ ] Caching strategy:
  - [ ] Cache chunk boundaries per track (avoid re-analysis)
  - [ ] Store boundary metadata in database
  - [ ] Invalidate cache if file changes

- [ ] Fallback behavior:
  - [ ] Use fixed 30s chunks if analysis fails
  - [ ] Use fixed chunks for very short tracks (<90s)
  - [ ] Configurable via settings (enable/disable smart chunking)

**Frontend**:
- [ ] Settings toggle for smart chunking (on by default)
- [ ] Display chunk boundaries in waveform view (optional)
- [ ] Performance metrics in debug mode (chunk analysis time)

**Technical Approach**:
```python
# Pseudocode example
def find_adaptive_chunk_boundaries(audio, sr, min_chunk=15, max_chunk=45):
    # 1. Calculate energy profile (RMS over time)
    energy = calculate_rms_envelope(audio, window_size=2048)

    # 2. Find mood transitions (significant energy changes)
    transitions = detect_energy_transitions(energy, threshold=6dB)

    # 3. Find silent regions
    silent_regions = detect_silence(audio, sr, threshold=-60dB, min_duration=0.5)

    # 4. Combine into candidate boundaries
    candidates = merge_candidates(transitions, silent_regions)

    # 5. Optimize chunk sizes (min/max constraints)
    boundaries = optimize_chunks(candidates, min_chunk, max_chunk)

    return boundaries
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Chunks split at musically/contextually appropriate points
- [ ] No splits in the middle of vocals or prominent sounds
- [ ] Chunk sizes stay within min/max bounds (15-45s)
