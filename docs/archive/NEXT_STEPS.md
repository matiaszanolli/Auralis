# Matchering Player - Next Steps

## 🎯 Current Status
✅ **Analysis Complete**: Thoroughly analyzed Matchering 2.0 codebase  
✅ **Architecture Designed**: Complete development plan created  
✅ **Project Structure**: Initial package structure established  
✅ **Foundation Code**: Basic configuration and DSP modules created  

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

### 1. Complete Core DSP Module
**Priority**: High | **Estimate**: 2-3 days

```bash
# Files to create:
matchering_player/dsp/__init__.py
matchering_player/dsp/processor.py      # Main realtime processor
matchering_player/dsp/levels.py         # Level matching logic
```

**Key Tasks**:
- Adapt Matchering's level analysis for realtime chunks
- Implement `RealtimeProcessor` class with 100ms buffer processing
- Create reference RMS caching system
- Add exponential smoothing for gain adjustments

### 2. Audio Manager Implementation  
**Priority**: High | **Estimate**: 3-4 days

```bash
# Files to create:
matchering_player/core/audio_manager.py  # PyAudio interface
matchering_player/utils/file_loader.py   # WAV/MP3 loading
```

**Key Tasks**:
- PyAudio-based audio playback system
- Circular buffer management for realtime processing
- File format support (WAV first, then MP3 via FFmpeg)
- Thread-safe audio callback system

### 3. Basic GUI Implementation
**Priority**: Medium | **Estimate**: 2-3 days

```bash
# Files to create:
matchering_player/ui/__init__.py
matchering_player/ui/main_window.py      # Main player window
matchering_player/ui/controls.py         # Play/pause/stop controls
```

**Key Tasks**:
- Simple PyQt6 or Tkinter interface
- Play/pause/stop/seek controls
- Reference track selection
- Effect enable/disable toggle
- Basic waveform visualization

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment

# macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/
```

### Run Development Tests
```bash
# Test basic DSP functions
python -c "from matchering_player.dsp.basic import *; print('DSP module working')"

# Test configuration system
python -c "from matchering_player.core.config import PlayerConfig; print(PlayerConfig())"

# Test audio loading (when implemented)
python -m matchering_player.utils.file_loader test_audio.wav
```

### Build and Package
```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the player
python -m matchering_player
```

## 🔬 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Create test structure
tests/
├── test_dsp_basic.py           # Test DSP functions
├── test_processor.py           # Test realtime processor  
├── test_audio_manager.py       # Test audio I/O
└── test_integration.py         # End-to-end tests
```

### Performance Tests
- Processing latency measurement
- CPU usage monitoring
- Memory leak detection
- Audio dropout detection

### Audio Quality Tests
- A/B testing with reference tracks
- RMS level matching accuracy
- Audio artifacts detection
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🎵 Demo Preparation

### Test Audio Files
```bash
# Prepare test files
test_files/
├── target_demo.wav             # Home recording demo
├── reference_hit.wav           # Professional reference
├── quiet_song.wav              # Low RMS test case
└── loud_song.wav               # High RMS test case
```

### Demo Scenarios
1. **"Before/After" Demo**: Load demo track, apply reference, show immediate improvement
2. **"Live Toggle" Demo**: Real-time effect enable/disable during playback  
3. **"Reference Comparison" Demo**: Same track with different references

## ⚡ Performance Optimization Priorities

### Week 1 Targets
- [ ] <10ms processing latency
- [ ] <15% CPU usage during playback
- [ ] Zero audio dropouts on modern hardware
- [ ] Stable operation for 30+ minutes

### Optimization Techniques
- NumPy vectorized operations
- Minimal memory allocations in audio thread
- Pre-computed reference statistics
- Adaptive quality based on CPU load

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: PyAudio installation issues  
**Mitigation**: Provide conda environment and Docker option

**Risk**: Real-time performance on slower hardware  
**Mitigation**: Performance mode with reduced quality, system requirements documentation

**Risk**: Audio quality degradation  
**Mitigation**: Always-available bypass mode, conservative default settings

### Development Risks  
**Risk**: Scope creep during MVP development  
**Mitigation**: Strict adherence to Phase 1 requirements, feature parking lot

## 📈 Success Criteria for Week 1

### Must Have (MVP Requirements)
✅ Load and play WAV files  
✅ Apply basic level matching in real-time  
✅ Reference track selection and caching  
✅ Effect enable/disable toggle  
✅ Stable playback without crashes  

### Should Have (Nice to Have)
✅ MP3 format support  
✅ Basic waveform visualization  
✅ RMS level meters  
✅ Processing latency indicator  

### Could Have (Future Phases)
- Frequency matching
- Stereo width control  
- Advanced visualizations
- Preset system
- Export functionality

## 📞 Decision Points

### GUI Framework Choice
**Options**: PyQt6 (professional), Tkinter (simple), Web-based (cross-platform)  
**Recommendation**: Start with PyQt6 for professional look, fallback to Tkinter if needed

### Audio Backend Choice  
**Options**: PyAudio (simple), RtAudio (advanced), JACK (pro audio)  
**Recommendation**: PyAudio for MVP, evaluate others in Phase 2

### Reference Storage Format
**Options**: JSON (simple), SQLite (scalable), Binary (fast)  
**Recommendation**: JSON for MVP, migrate to SQLite in Phase 2

---

**Next Action**: Begin implementation of `matchering_player/dsp/processor.py` using the established DSP foundations and Matchering's level matching algorithms.
