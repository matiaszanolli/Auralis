# Phase 1 Testing & Polish Plan

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Phase 1 Completion**: 80% (4/5 tasks)
**Testing Focus**: Favorites, Playlists, Album Art, Queue Management

---

## üéØ Testing Goals

1. **Verify all Phase 1 features work correctly**
2. **Identify and fix bugs**
3. **Improve UI/UX based on real usage**
4. **Ensure data persistence across sessions**
5. **Document any issues for future fixes**

---

## üöÄ Starting the Application

### Method 1: Production Mode (Recommended for Testing)

```bash
cd /mnt/data/src/matchering

# Start backend only (avoids file watcher issues)
python launch-auralis-web.py

# Open browser at http://localhost:8765
```

**Why production mode?**
- No file watcher limits ("too many open files" error)
- Faster startup
- More stable for extended testing
- Uses pre-built frontend

---

### Method 2: Check Backend Health

Before testing, verify backend is running:

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8765/api/health

# Expected output:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "library_stats": { ... }
# }
```

---

## üß™ Feature Testing Checklist

### 1. Favorites System (Task 1.1)

#### Backend Testing

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/library/tracks/{id}/favorite`

```bash
# Add track to favorites
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/library/tracks/1/favorite

# Expected response:
# {
#   "message": "Track added to favorites",
#   "track_id": 1,
#   "favorite": true
# }

# Get favorites list
curl http://localhost:8765/api/library/tracks/favorites

# Expected response:
# {
#   "tracks": [ ... ],

# Expected response:
# {
#   "message": "Artwork extracted successfully",
#   "artwork_path": "/home/user/.auralis/artwork/album_1_a3f2b9c1.jpg",
#   "album_id": 1
# }

# Delete artwork
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8765/api/albums/1/artwork
```

---

#### Frontend Testing

**Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Open "Songs" view in library
2. ‚úÖ Check if album art displays in grid cards
3. ‚úÖ Look for loading skeleton animation (brief flash)
4. ‚úÖ Verify placeholder icon shows for tracks without artwork

- Loading skeleton appears briefly during image load
- Smooth fade-in animation when artwork loads
- Placeholder album icon for missing artwork
- Player bar updates artwork when track changes
- Artwork is cached by browser (second load is instant)

**Testing with Real Audio Files**:
```bash
# Scan a folder with audio files that have embedded artwork
# Use the "Scan Folder" button in the UI

# OR via API:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/library/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"directory":"/path/to/music/folder"}'
```

**Supported Formats**:
- ‚úÖ MP3 (ID3 tags)

- ‚úÖ M4A/MP4 (covr atom)
- ‚úÖ OGG (Vorbis comments)

**Known Issues**:
- Artwork not automatically extracted during library scan (manual extraction needed)
- No artwork upload UI (API works, UI not implemented)

curl -X PUT http://localhost:8765/api/player/queue/reorder \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"new_order":[1,2,0,3,4]}'

# Shuffle queue
curl -X POST http://localhost:8765/api/player/queue/shuffle

## üîß Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: "Too many open files" error

**Symptom**: Backend crashes with file watcher error when using `--dev` flag

**Cause**: System file descriptor limit exceeded by Vite dev server

**Workaround**: Use production mode instead
```bash
# Instead of:
python launch-auralis-web.py --dev

# Use:
python launch-auralis-web.py
```

**Permanent Fix**: Increase file descriptor limit (requires system configuration)

---

### Issue 2: Frontend not loading

**Symptom**: Blank page or "Failed to load" error

**Cause**: Frontend build not present

**Fix**: Build frontend first
```bash
cd auralis-web/frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

---

### Issue 3: Database migration errors

**Symptom**: "Table already exists" or "Column not found" errors

**Cause**: Database schema out of sync

**Fix**: Delete database and rescan
```bash
# CAUTION: This deletes all library data
rm ~/.auralis/library.db

# Restart backend (will recreate database)
python launch-auralis-web.py

# Rescan your music folder
```

# 2. Open browser
# Navigate to http://localhost:8765

# 3. Test each feature (5 minutes each):
# - Add/remove favorites
# - Create/delete playlist
# - Check album artwork displays
# - Reorder queue with drag-and-drop

# 4. Look for:
