# Auralis Beta.4 Release Notes

**Version**: 1.0.0-beta.4
**Release Date**: October 27, 2025
**Codename**: "Unified Streaming"

---

## 🎉 Major Features

### Unified MSE + Multi-Tier Buffer System

**The biggest feature in Auralis history!** Complete redesign of the audio streaming architecture that eliminates dual playback conflicts while enabling instant preset switching.

#### What's New

**🚀 Instant Preset Switching**
- Switch between presets (Adaptive, Warm, Bright, Punchy, Gentle) with near-zero latency
- Progressive streaming in unenhanced mode
- Intelligent buffering in enhanced mode
- **Target: <100ms switch time** with L1 cache

**🔄 Unified Player Architecture**
- Single streaming endpoint handles both MSE and MTB
- Seamless mode transitions (Enhanced ↔ Unenhanced)
- Position preservation during mode switches
- No more audio glitches or overlapping playback

**⚡ New Backend Components**
- WebM/Opus encoder with async ffmpeg
- Intelligent routing based on enhancement state
- Automatic caching system (WebM chunks)
- 75% test coverage on unified streaming

**🎨 Redesigned Player UI**
- New `BottomPlayerBarUnified` component
- Mode indicator chip (MSE/HTML5)
- State indicators (loading, switching, buffering)
- **67% code reduction** (970→320 lines)
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

#### Technical Details

**Architecture**:
```
Unified Endpoint: /api/audio/stream/{track_id}/*
├── enhanced=false → Progressive WebM/Opus streaming (MSE)
└── enhanced=true  → Intelligent WAV buffering (MTB)
```

**Frontend**:
```
UnifiedPlayerManager
├── MSEPlayerInternal (unenhanced mode)
│   ├── MediaSource API
│   ├── SourceBuffer management
│   └── Progressive chunk loading
└── HTML5AudioPlayerInternal (enhanced mode)
    ├── Standard Audio element
    └── Real-time processing
```

**Performance**:
- WebM encoding: 2-3s for 30s chunk (first time)
- Cache hits: <10ms (instant)
- Memory: Automatic cleanup prevents leaks
