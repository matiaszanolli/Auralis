# Spectrum-Based Processing - Refinement Status

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Session**: Anchor Point Tuning and Testament/Slayer Testing

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Refined "live" Anchor Point ✅

**File**: `auralis/core/analysis/spectrum_mapper.py`

Changed live preset anchor:
```python
output_target_rms=-11.0  # Increased from -13.5 dB
```

### 2. Added Content Rules for Loud Material ✅

**File**: `auralis/core/analysis/spectrum_mapper.py`

```python
# Rule: Very loud material (input_level > 0.8)
if position.input_level > 0.8:
    params.output_target_rms = -11.0 dB

# Rule: Loud + dynamic (input_level > 0.7, dynamic_range > 0.4)
elif position.input_level > 0.7 and position.dynamic_range > 0.4:
    params.output_target_rms = -12.0 dB
```

### 3. Refined Dynamic Material Processing ✅

**File**: `auralis/core/analysis/spectrum_mapper.py`

```python
# Differentiate high-energy dynamic (metal) from low-energy dynamic (classical)
if position.dynamic_range > 0.75:
    if position.energy < 0.6:
        # Classical/jazz - very gentle
        params.compression_amount *= 0.5
    else:
        # Metal/live - moderate reduction
        params.compression_amount *= 0.8
```

### 4. Fixed Final Normalization Strategy ✅

**File**: `auralis/core/hybrid_processor.py`

**Problem**: Original approach of peak-then-RMS created a loop where increasing RMS also increased peak, requiring re-normalization.

**Solution**:
1. Apply RMS boost BEFORE peak normalization (if needed)
2. Then normalize peak to -0.1 dB
3. Accept final RMS as constrained by crest factor and peak limit

```python
# Apply RMS boost first (if rms_diff > 0.5 dB)
if rms_diff_from_target > 0.5:
    processed_audio = amplify(processed_audio, rms_boost)

# Then normalize peak to -0.1 dB
processed_audio = processed_audio * (target_peak / peak)
```

### 5. Limited Stereo Width Expansion for Loud Material ✅

**File**: `auralis/core/hybrid_processor.py`

**Problem**: Stereo width expansion was boosting peaks dramatically (Testament: -0.05 → +2.80 dB)

**Solution**: Limit stereo width expansion for already-loud material
```python
if spectrum_position.input_level > 0.8 and target_width > current_width:
    max_width_increase = 0.3  # Only allow +0.3 increase
    target_width = min(target_width, current_width + max_width_increase)
```

**Result**: Testament peak boost reduced to +0.23 dB (was +2.85 dB)

## Test Results

### Static-X - "Fix" (Under-leveled) ✅ EXCELLENT

```
ORIGINAL:
  Peak: -8.65 dB, RMS: -20.78 dB, Crest: 12.13 dB

MATCHERING EXPECTED:
  RMS Δ: +6.73 dB

AURALIS RESULT:
  RMS Δ: +6.51 dB

ACCURACY: 0.22 dB off ✅ EXCELLENT
```

**Why it works**: Under-leveled material correctly identified, aggressive boost applied, dynamics preserved.

### Testament - "The Preacher" (Loud + Dynamic Live) ✅ GOOD

```
ORIGINAL:
  Peak: -0.38 dB, RMS: -12.93 dB, Crest: 12.55 dB

MATCHERING EXPECTED:
  RMS Δ: +1.48 dB, Crest Δ: -1.20 dB

AURALIS RESULT:
  RMS Δ: -0.22 dB, Crest Δ: -0.00 dB

ACCURACY: 1.70 dB RMS off, 1.20 dB Crest off ⚠️ GOOD
```

**Why it's off**:
- Spectrum correctly identifies as very loud (Level: 0.88)
- Stereo width expansion now limited (prevents +2.80 dB peak boost)
- RMS boost applied (+1.11 dB) but then peak normalization reduces it (-1.39 dB)
- **Root cause**: Crest factor preserved at 12.29 dB (should be reduced to ~11.35 dB)
- Matchering applies **light compression** to reduce crest by -1.20 dB
- Our dynamics processor is disabled, so no crest reduction occurs

### Slayer - "South of Heaven" (Well-mastered Metal) ⏭️ NOT YET TESTED

---

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Peak vs RMS vs Crest Factor Relationship ✅

**Critical Insight**: With peak normalized to -0.1 dB, final RMS is **entirely determined by crest factor**:

```
RMS (dB) = Peak (dB) - Crest Factor (dB)

Example (Testament):
  Peak: -0.10 dB
  Crest: 12.29 dB
  Therefore: RMS = -0.10 - 12.29 = -12.39 dB ✓
```

This means:
- To increase RMS, we must EITHER increase peak OR decrease crest factor
- Since peak is fixed at -0.1 dB, **we must reduce crest factor via compression**

### 2. Matchering Uses Light Compression on Loud Material ✅

**Evidence from Testament**:
- Original crest: 12.55 dB
- Matchering crest: 11.35 dB
- Change: -1.20 dB (compression applied)

**Evidence from Static-X**:
- Original crest: 12.13 dB
- Matchering crest: 14.17 dB
- Change: +2.04 dB (NO compression, preserved/improved dynamics)

**Conclusion**: Matchering applies compression adaptively:
- Under-leveled material: NO compression (preserve/improve dynamics)
- Already-loud material: LIGHT compression (increase competitive loudness)

### 3. Stereo Width Expansion Can Dramatically Boost Peaks ✅

**Testament Example**:
- Before stereo: Peak -0.05 dB
- After stereo: Peak +2.80 dB
- Change: +2.85 dB (!)

**Solution**: Limit stereo width expansion for loud material (max +0.3 increase)

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Testament Needs Light Compression ⚠️

**Problem**: Crest factor preserved at 12.29 dB, needs to be ~11.35 dB (-0.94 dB reduction)

**Options**:
1. **Re-enable dynamics processor** with spectrum-aware settings
   - Apply light compression (ratio 2:1) ONLY for loud material
   - Threshold: -15 dB
   - Makeup gain to compensate

2. **Add simple compression to final normalization stage**
   - Apply after stereo processing, before peak normalization
   - Very gentle (ratio 1.5:1-2:1)
   - Only for material with input_level > 0.8

3. **Accept current results as "GOOD"** (1.70 dB off)
   - Current results are usable
   - 1.70 dB is close to 2.0 dB "GOOD" threshold

### 2. Slayer Needs Testing ⏭️

Haven't tested Slayer yet to see if well-mastered metal works correctly.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)

1. ✅ **Static-X**: EXCELLENT (0.22 dB off)
2. ✅ **Testament**: GOOD (1.70 dB off) - acceptable but could improve
3. ⏭️ **Test Slayer**: Validate well-mastered metal processing

### Short Term

4. **Add light compression for loud material**:
   - Option A: Simple compression in final normalization
   - Option B: Re-enable dynamics processor with spectrum control
   - Target: Reduce crest by -1 to -2 dB for loud material

5. **Test with more tracks**:
   - Iron Maiden (well-mastered classic)
   - Soda Stereo (new wave)
   - More Testament tracks (verify consistency)

### Medium Term

6. **Refine stereo width strategy**:
   - Current: Hard limit of +0.3 for loud material
   - Better: Gradual scaling based on input level
   - Even better: Peak-aware stereo expansion (stop if peak exceeds threshold)

7. **Add more anchor points**:
   - "Classical" - High dynamics, low energy
   - "Electronic" - Moderate dynamics, high density
