## Adaptive Mastering System Design

### 1. Intelligent Target Generation

**Replace reference files with adaptive models:**

```python
class AdaptiveMasteringEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.genre_detector = GenreDetector()
        self.style_analyzer = StyleAnalyzer()
        self.quality_assessor = QualityMetrics()
        self.user_preferences = UserPreferences()

    def generate_mastering_targets(self, audio_data):
        # Analyze audio content
        genre = self.genre_detector.classify(audio_data)
        style_features = self.style_analyzer.extract_features(audio_data)
        quality_scores = self.quality_assessor.assess_quality(audio_data)

        # Generate adaptive targets based on content
        targets = self.calculate_adaptive_targets(
            genre=genre,
            style=style_features,
            quality=quality_scores,
            user_prefs=self.user_preferences.get_profile()
        )

        return targets
```

### 2. Content-Aware Processing

**Different mastering approaches for different content:**

- **Rock/Metal**: Punch and clarity, controlled limiting, frequency balance
- **Vocal/Acoustic**: Clarity and presence, gentle compression, vocal range enhancement
- **Podcast/Speech**: Intelligibility optimization, noise reduction, consistent levels

### 3. Real-time Adaptation

**Continuous optimization during playback:**

```python
class RealtimeAdaptiveProcessor:
    def process_chunk(self, audio_chunk):
        # Analyze current chunk
        chunk_analysis = self.analyze_chunk(audio_chunk)

        # Update adaptive parameters
        self.update_processing_parameters(chunk_analysis)

        # Apply adaptive processing
        processed_chunk = self.apply_adaptive_processing(audio_chunk)

        # Learn from user feedback
        self.update_learning_model(processed_chunk)

        return processed_chunk
```
