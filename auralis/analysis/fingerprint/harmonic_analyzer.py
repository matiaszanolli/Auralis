Harmonic Content Analyzer

Extracts harmonic features from audio for fingerprinting.

Features (3D):
  - harmonic_ratio: Ratio of harmonic to percussive content (0-1)
  - pitch_stability: How in-tune/stable the pitch is (0-1)
  - chroma_energy: Tonal complexity/richness (0-1)

Dependencies:
  - librosa for harmonic/percussive separation, chroma analysis
  - numpy for numerical operations
