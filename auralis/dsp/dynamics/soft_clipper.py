    Apply soft clipping to audio using tanh saturation

    This provides gentle, musical limiting that preserves loudness differences
    while preventing hard clipping.

    Args:
        audio: Input audio array
        threshold: Level where saturation begins (0.0-1.0)
        ceiling: Maximum output level (0.0-1.0)

    Returns:
        Soft-clipped audio

    Algorithm:
        - Below threshold: Linear (no change)
        - Above threshold: Smooth tanh curve approaching ceiling
        - Preserves overall loudness while catching peaks
