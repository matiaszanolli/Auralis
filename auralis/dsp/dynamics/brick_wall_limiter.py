Brick-Wall Limiter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

True peak limiting with look-ahead for transparent peak control

:copyright: (C) 2024 Auralis Team
:license: GPLv3, see LICENSE for more details.

A brick-wall limiter catches peaks above a threshold while preserving
overall loudness. Unlike peak normalization (which scales the entire signal),
a true limiter only reduces gain when peaks occur.

    True brick-wall limiter with look-ahead

    This limiter uses a look-ahead buffer to detect peaks before they occur,
    allowing it to apply gain reduction smoothly without audible artifacts.

    Key features:
    - Look-ahead peak detection (eliminates overshoot)
    - Smooth gain reduction envelope (no clicks/pops)
    - Preserves overall loudness (only reduces peaks)
    - Transparent limiting (minimal audible artifacts)

    Algorithm:
    1. Buffer audio with look-ahead delay
    2. Detect peaks in look-ahead window
    3. Calculate required gain reduction
    4. Apply smooth envelope to gain curve
    5. Multiply delayed audio by gain curve
