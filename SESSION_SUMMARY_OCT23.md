# Session Summary - October 23, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing a critical playback bug and updating the project roadmap with three new feature requests.

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixed: Playback Restart Loop

### Problem
Songs were playing for approximately 1 second and then restarting repeatedly in an infinite loop, making the music player unusable. The issue occurred regardless of whether audio enhancement (mastering) was enabled or disabled.

### Root Cause Analysis
From browser console logs, the issue was identified as:
```
Auto-play failed: DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a new load request
```

The audio stream was being loaded multiple times in rapid succession because:
1. User clicks track ‚Üí loads stream ‚Üí starts playing
2. WebSocket state update arrives from backend
3. React component re-renders due to state change
4. useEffect hook triggers (dependencies include enhancement settings)
5. Audio element reloads the stream URL
6. Stream reload interrupts the play() request ‚Üí DOMException
7. Backend state changes ‚Üí another WebSocket update ‚Üí **cycle repeats infinitely**

### Solution Implemented

Two guards were added to prevent duplicate stream loads:

#### Fix 1: Guard in `playTrack` Function
**File**: `auralis-web/frontend/src/hooks/usePlayerAPI.ts` (lines 296-305)

```typescript
const playTrack = useCallback(async (track: Track) => {
  // Guard: Don't restart if same track is already playing
  if (playerState.currentTrack?.id === track.id && playerState.isPlaying) {
    console.log('‚úã Already playing this track, ignoring duplicate play request');
    return;
  }

  console.log('‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playing track:', track.title);
  await setQueue([track], 0);
}, [setQueue, playerState]);
```

**Effect**: Prevents unnecessary API calls when user clicks the same track that's already playing.

#### Fix 2: Enhanced Stream Reload Protection
**File**: `auralis-web/frontend/src/components/BottomPlayerBarConnected.tsx` (lines 180-188)

```typescript
// Additional guard: Don't reload if track ID and enhancement settings haven't changed
const isSameTrackAndSettings =
  lastLoadedTrackId.current === currentTrack.id &&
  audioRef.current.src.includes(`/stream/${currentTrack.id}`);

if (isSameTrackAndSettings && currentStreamUrl && !audioRef.current.paused) {
  console.log(`‚úÖ Same track already loaded and playing, skipping reload`);
  return;
}
```

**Effect**: Prevents audio element from reloading when WebSocket state updates arrive for a track that's already loaded and playing.

### Results
- ‚úÖ Playback is now stable and continuous
- ‚úÖ No more infinite restart loops
- ‚úÖ Songs play normally from start to finish
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of duplicate click attempts
- ‚úÖ Clear console debug messages for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Frontend rebuilt successfully (3.93s build time)
- ‚úÖ Backend serving new frontend build

## üîß Additional Fixes

### Playlist Repository Fix
**Issue**: SQLAlchemy session error when loading playlists
```
Parent instance <Playlist> is not bound to a Session; lazy load operation cannot proceed
```

**Fix**: Added eager loading in `PlaylistRepository.get_all()` method
```python
def get_all(self) -> List[Playlist]:
    """Get all playlists with eager loading"""
    session = self.get_session()
    try:
        playlists = session.query(Playlist).options(
            selectinload(Playlist.tracks)  # FIX: Eager load tracks
        ).order_by(Playlist.name).all()
        for playlist in playlists:
            session.expunge(playlist)
        return playlists
    finally:
        session.close()
```

**File**: `auralis/library/repositories/playlist_repository.py` (lines 96-108)

**Result**: Playlists now load correctly without session errors.

### Database Migration Verification
**Status**: Automatic migration system working correctly

**Observed**:
- Backend detected v1 database
- Created automatic backup: `auralis_library.backup_20251023_132529.db`
- Executed migration script: `migration_v001_to_v002.sql`
- Recorded migration in `schema_migrations` table
- Migration completed successfully: v1 ‚Üí v2

**Log excerpt**:
```
INFO:auralis.library.migrations:Database migration needed: v1 ‚Üí v2
INFO:auralis.library.migrations:‚úÖ Database backed up to: ~/Music/Auralis/auralis_library.backup_20251023_132529.db
INFO:auralis.library.migrations:Migrating database from v1 to v2
INFO:auralis.library.migrations:‚úÖ Database successfully migrated to v2
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap Updates

Three new features were added to the Auralis development roadmap based on user request:

### 1. Track Metadata Editing & Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Location**: Phase 4.1
**Timeline**: 4-5 days
**Priority**: üî¥ HIGH

**Summary**: Allow users to edit and manage track metadata directly within Auralis, eliminating the need for external tag editors like Kid3, EasyTAG, or MusicBrainz Picard.

**Key Features**:
- Edit all common metadata fields (Title, Artist, Album, Track#, Year, Genre, BPM, Lyrics, Comments)
- Batch editing for multiple tracks
- Format-specific tag support (MP3, FLAC, M4A, OGG, WAV)
- Auto-populate from filename patterns
- Fetch metadata from MusicBrainz/Discogs
- Tag cleanup tools (trim whitespace, fix capitalization)
- Preview changes before saving
- Optional backup before editing

**API Endpoints**:
- `PUT /api/library/tracks/:id/metadata` - Update track metadata
- `GET /api/library/tracks/:id/metadata/formats` - Get available format-specific tags
- `POST /api/library/tracks/batch/metadata` - Batch metadata update

**UI Components**:
- EditMetadataDialog with form validation
- Batch editing interface
- Context menu integration (right-click ‚Üí "Edit Metadata")
- Track detail view with inline editing

---

### 2. Smart Chunk Shaping (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Location**: Phase 4.2
**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM

**Summary**: Improve chunked streaming by using intelligent chunk boundaries based on audio content (mood, energy, silence) rather than fixed 30-second intervals.

**Technical Approach**:
1. Analyze audio waveform for natural break points
2. Detect silent sections (below -60dB threshold)
3. Identify mood/energy transitions using RMS and spectral changes
4. Detect tempo changes and beat boundaries
5. Optimize chunk sizes (15-45s range)

**New Module**: `AdaptiveChunkShaper`
```python
analyze_chunk_points(audio, sr, min_chunk=15s, max_chunk=45s)
detect_mood_changes(audio, sr)
find_silent_regions(audio, sr, threshold=-60dB)
align_to_beats(audio, sr, boundaries)  # optional
```

**Benefits**:
- More natural listening experience
- No splits in the middle of vocals or prominent sounds
- Fewer audible crossfade artifacts
- Chunks align with musical structure
- Minimal overhead (<1s analysis time, <10% performance impact)

**Integration**:
- Integrates with existing ChunkedAudioProcessor (Phase 1.5)
- Cache chunk boundaries in database per track
- Fallback to fixed 30s chunks if analysis fails
- Configurable via settings (enable/disable)

### 3. Mastering Algorithm Performance Review (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Location**: Phase 5.1
**Timeline**: 7-10 days (4 phases)
**Priority**: üìä LOW-MEDIUM

**Summary**: Conduct comprehensive review of the adaptive mastering algorithm to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

**Note**: Current performance is already excellent (52.8x real-time, 197x with optimizations). This review is about finding additional gains.

**Four-Phase Approach**:

#### Phase 1: Profiling & Analysis (3-4 days)
- Profile entire processing pipeline (HybridProcessor, DSP stages, content analysis)
- Memory profiling (identify leaks, track NumPy allocations)
- Identify hotspots (CPU-intensive operations)
- Benchmark current performance (by file size, format, preset)
- Tools: cProfile, line_profiler, py-spy, memory_profiler

#### Phase 2: Algorithm Review (2-3 days)
- Review adaptive mastering algorithm logic
- Review DSP implementations (FFT, filters, resampling, stereo)
- Compare with reference implementations (librosa, scipy.signal, pydub)

#### Phase 3: Optimization Implementation (2-3 days)
**Potential optimizations**:
- NumPy/SciPy: In-place operations, vectorization
- FFT: Use FFTW via pyfftw, cache FFT plans, parallelize stereo
- Caching: Cache content analysis, genre classification, FFT intermediates
- Parallel Processing: Parallelize stereo channels, batch operations
- Algorithm Simplifications: Reduce EQ bands (26‚Üí18), simplify genre classification
- Memory: More aggressive pooling, float32 vs float64

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1-2 days)
- Benchmark each optimization (measure speedup)
- Audio quality verification (PESQ, VISQOL scores)
- A/B test original vs optimized output
- Create MASTERING_ALGORITHM_PERFORMANCE.md report

**Success Criteria**:
- At least 3 significant bottlenecks identified
- At least 2 optimizations implemented and tested
- 10-20% performance improvement on common use cases
- Audio quality maintained (verified by objective metrics)
- No test suite regressions
