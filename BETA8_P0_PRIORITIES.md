# Beta.8 P0 Priority Roadmap

**Date**: October 30-31, 2025
**Status**: 🟡 **1 OF 3 P0 ISSUES RESOLVED** (MSE Activation ✅)
**Target**: Beta.8 Release

---

## 🚨 P0 Critical Issues (Must Fix for Beta.8)

### 1. **Initial Chunk Caching Time - UNACCEPTABLE** 🔴

**Current Behavior**: First chunk takes **15-20 seconds** to cache before playback starts

**Root Cause**:
- Full audio processing pipeline runs for 30-second chunk
- Fingerprint analysis (librosa tempo detection) is slow (~2-3s)
- EQ processing, dynamics, stereo width all run sequentially
- No optimization for initial chunk

**Target**: **< 2 seconds** initial buffering time

**Solution Options**:

**Option A: Parallel Chunk Processing** (Recommended)
```python
# Process first 3 chunks in parallel
async def load_track_fast(track_id, preset, intensity):
    # Start all 3 chunks simultaneously
    chunk_tasks = [
        process_chunk_async(track_id, 0, preset, intensity),
        process_chunk_async(track_id, 1, preset, intensity),
        process_chunk_async(track_id, 2, preset, intensity)
    ]

    # Wait for first chunk only
    first_chunk = await chunk_tasks[0]

    # Start playback immediately
    return first_chunk  # Others continue in background
```

**Benefits**:
- First chunk ready in ~5-7s (still slow, but better)
- Chunks 1-2 ready when needed (seamless playback)
- Uses multi-core CPU efficiently

**Option B: Lightweight First-Pass Processing**
```python
# Fast path for first chunk
def process_chunk_fast(audio, sr, preset):
    # Skip expensive analysis
    - NO fingerprint analysis (use track-level cache)
    - NO librosa tempo detection
    - Simple RMS-based loudness only
    - Minimal EQ (3-band instead of 26-band)
    - Fast limiter only

    # Result: ~500ms processing time
```

**Benefits**:
- **< 1 second** initial buffering
- Good enough quality for immediate playback
- Full processing happens in background for remaining chunks

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (BEST)
```python
1. Check if track fingerprint is cached
   - YES: Use cached analysis, fast processing (~2-3s)
   - NO: Use lightweight first-pass, analyze in background

2. First chunk: Lightweight processing (< 1s)
3. Background: Full analysis + re-process chunks 0-2 with full quality
4. Seamless upgrade when ready
```

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Add `fast_mode=True` parameter to `HybridProcessor`
- [ ] Implement lightweight processing path (3-band EQ, simple limiter)
- [ ] Cache track-level fingerprints in database
- [ ] Add background re-processing queue
- [ ] Seamless buffer upgrade mechanism

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Initial playback starts in **< 2 seconds**
- ✅ Full quality applied within 10 seconds (background)
- ✅ No audible glitches during quality upgrade

### 2. **Preset Quality Issues** 🔴

**Current Behavior**: Presets sound wrong/inconsistent

**Specific Issues Observed**:
- Presets don't have distinct character
- Some presets sound over-processed
- Dynamics changes inconsistent between presets
- User expectations not met

**Target**: Each preset should have **clear, predictable sonic character**

**Investigation Needed**:
1. **User Testing**:
   - Which presets sound good vs bad?
   - What specific issues? (too bright, too compressed, muddy, harsh?)
   - Compare to reference (e.g., iTunes Sound Enhancer, Spotify normalization)

2. **Measurement**:
   - Frequency response differences between presets
   - Dynamic range differences
   - Actual vs intended processing amounts

3. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Are preset parameters correct?
   - Is content-adaptive logic overriding preset character?
   - Are genre curves appropriate?

**Proposed Preset Redesign**:

```python
# ADAPTIVE (Default) - Intelligent, Balanced
- Target: Preserve dynamics, intelligent EQ based on content
- RMS: Content-adaptive (-18 to -12 dB depending on source)
- EQ: Psychoacoustic 26-band, corrective only
- Compression: Minimal (only if needed)
- Character: "This is what the artist intended, but better"

# GENTLE - Subtle Enhancement
- Target: Barely noticeable, audiophile-friendly
- RMS: Source-relative (max +2 dB)
- EQ: Minimal correction (±2 dB max)
- Compression: None
- Character: "Did anything even change?"

# WARM - Smooth, Analog-like
- Target: Vintage analog warmth
- RMS: -16 dB (comfortable listening)
- EQ: +3dB sub-bass (60-100Hz), -2dB highs (8-16kHz), +1dB low-mids (200-400Hz)
- Compression: Soft 2:1 ratio
- Saturation: Subtle tape-style harmonics
- Character: "Vinyl warmth, cozy listening"

# BRIGHT - Clear, Modern
- Target: Studio monitor clarity
- RMS: -14 dB (energetic)
- EQ: +4dB presence (2-4kHz), +2dB air (12-16kHz), -1dB low-mids
- Compression: Minimal
- Character: "Studio reference, detail retrieval"

# PUNCHY - Impactful, Energetic
- Target: Club/car audio impact
- RMS: -12 dB (loud, energetic)
- EQ: +5dB sub-bass (40-80Hz), +3dB upper-mids (2-4kHz)
- Compression: Aggressive 3:1 ratio
- Limiting: -0.1 dB peak (maximize loudness)
- Character: "Turn it up! Maximum impact!"
```

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] A/B test current vs proposed presets
- [ ] Document expected frequency response for each preset
- [ ] Add preset validation tests (measure actual output)
- [ ] User feedback on Beta.8 preview builds

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Blind A/B test: Users correctly identify preset character >80% of time
- ✅ Frequency response matches design spec (±1.5 dB)
- ✅ No user complaints about "all presets sound the same"

### 3. **MSE Activation** ✅ **FIXED** (Oct 31, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - MSE now working for all tracks (cached and uncached)

**Issues Fixed**:
1. ✅ CORS errors (added Vite proxy configuration)
2. ✅ Race condition in initialization (added 100ms timeout)
3. ✅ URL mismatch (corrected `/api/mse_streaming/...` → `/api/mse/stream/...`)
4. ✅ Multi-tier worker async bugs (added missing `await` keywords)
5. ✅ **Critical: On-demand processing** (changed `_get_chunk_path()` → `process_chunk()`)

**Result**: MSE progressive streaming now fully operational

**Documentation**: See [docs/sessions/oct30_beta7_mse_migration/BETA7_MSE_ON_DEMAND_FIX.md](docs/sessions/oct30_beta7_mse_migration/BETA7_MSE_ON_DEMAND_FIX.md) for complete fix details

**Testing Instructions**:
1. Open http://localhost:3005 (or current Vite dev server port)
2. Play any track (including previously failing tracks)
3. Verify MSE progressive streaming works
4. Test preset switching (should be ~2s uncached, < 100ms cached)
